After work, me and the boys
Go down to Killey's and we make some noise
Feed that old jukebox and play some air guitar
Well, and there's nothin' wrong with shootin' pool
And having some fun and acting a fool
But this time I won't be going where they are

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm going home and rock my baby
Just thinkin' 'bout her is making me crazy
And all day long, I've been dreamin' of holdin' her tight
Yeah, it's gonna be a sweet surrender
Candle light and love-me-tender
I'm going home and rock my baby tonight

[Verse 2]
The girl sure has been working hard
I thank she's ready for some R&R
Something to take her mind off everything
Champagne and a box of candy
A dozen roses might come in handy
To help loosen up those apron strings

[Chorus]
See Shenandoah LiveGet tickets as low as $30You might also like[Bridge]
If the roses and the candy do the trick
Tomorrow, I may have to call in sick

[Chorus]

Yeah, I'm going home and rock my baby tonightEmbed
