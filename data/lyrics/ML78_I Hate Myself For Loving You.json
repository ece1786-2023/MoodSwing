Uh\n\n[Verse 2]\nDaylight, spent the night without you\nBut I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do\nI'm over bein' angry 'bout the hell you put me through\nHey, man, bet you can treat me right\nYou just don't know what you was missin' last night\nI wanna see you begging, say forget it just for spite\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI think of you every night and day\nYou took my heart and you took my pride away\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate myself for loving you\nCan't break free from the things that you do\nI wanna walk but I run back to you\nThat's why I hate myself for loving you\nOw! Uh\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI think of you every night and day\nYou took my heart and you took my pride away\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate myself for loving you\nCan't break free from the things that you do\nI wanna walk but I run back to you\nThat's why I hate myself for loving you\nOw! Uh\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate myself for loving you\nCan't break free from the things that you do\nI wanna walk but I run back to you\nThat's why I hate myself for loving you\nOw! Uh\n[Outro]\nI hate myself for loving you\nI hate myself for loving you\nI hate myself for loving you\nI hate myself\nI hate myself for loving you2Embed"
