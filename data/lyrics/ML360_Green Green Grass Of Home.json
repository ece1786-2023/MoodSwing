 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsGreen, Green Grass of Home LyricsThe old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train\nAnd there to meet me is my mama and papa\nAnd down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries\nIt's good to touch the green green grass of home\nYes they'll all come to meet me arms areached smiling sweetly\nIt's so good to touch the green green grass of home\nThe old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry\nAnd there's that old oak tree that I used to play on\nDown the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries\nIt's good to touch the green green grass of home\nThen I awake and look around me at these four grey walls that surround me\nAnd I realize that I was only dreaming\nFor there's a guard and there's that sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak\nAnd again I'll touch the green green grass of home\nThey'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree\nAs they lay me neath the green green grass of homeYou might also likeEmbed"
