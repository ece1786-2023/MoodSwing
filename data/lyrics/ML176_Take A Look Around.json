One of them is carrying a briefcase. Your mission is to obtain the disc from the briefcase.\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nAll the tension in the world today\nAll the little girls fillin' up the world today\nWhen the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good\nBut I'ma live my life like I should (Like I should)\nNow all the critics wanna hit it\nYa shit can how we did it, just because they don't get it\nBut I'll stay fitted, new era committed\nNow this red cap gets a rap from these critics\nBut do we always gotta cry?\nDo we always gotta live inside a lie?\nLife's just a blast that's movin' really fast\nYou better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass\nFollow me into a solo\nRemember that, kid? So what you wanna do?\nAnd where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a\nMic pointed at your grill like a gun?\nLimp Bizkit is rockin' the set\nIt's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin', you bet\nSo don't be upset when you're broke and you're done\n'Cause I'ma be the one till I jet (I'ma be the one till I jet)\nSee Limp Bizkit LiveGet tickets as low as $92You might also like[Chorus 1]\nI know why you wanna hate me\nI know why you wanna hate me\nI know why you wanna hate me\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately\nI know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)\nI know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)\nNow I know why you wanna hate me\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!\n\n[Refrain]\nAnd now you wanna hate me!\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!\nAnd now you wanna hate me!\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!\n\n[Verse 2: Fred Durst]\nDoes anybody really know the secret?\nOr the combination for this life and where they keep it?\nIt's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'\nBut everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)\nI don't even know what I should say\n'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser\nI analyze every second I exist\nBeatin' up my mind every second with my fists\nAnd everybody wanna run (Wanna run)\nEverybody wanna hide from the gun (Hide from the gun)\nYou can take that ride through this life, if you want\nBut you can't take the edge off the knife (No, sir!)\nAnd now you want your money back (Your money back)\nBut you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sack\nAnd there ain't nothin' I can do\n'Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through\n[Chorus 1]\nI know why you wanna hate me\nI know why you wanna hate me\nI know why you wanna hate me\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately\nI know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)\nI know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)\nNow I know why you wanna hate me\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!\n\n[Refrain]\nAnd now you wanna hate me!\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!\nAnd now you wanna hate me!\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!\n\n[Bridge]\n(Shhhhhh...)\nNow I know why\nNow I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)\nNow I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)\nNow I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)\n\n[Chorus 2]\nNow I know why you wanna hate me!\nNow I know why you wanna hate me!\nNow I know why you wanna hate me!\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!\n'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!\n[Outro (Video version only)]\n\"Hello?\"\n\"Mr. Durst? Abort the mission, the man in the diner had decoys. Thanks anyway.\"\n\"This message will self-destruct in five seconds.\"15Embed"
