6 ContributorsBurn It Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
You think you know me?
You don't know shit
I've seen the world through your eyes
And it makes me sick
I've questioned all of your answers
They're fucking lies
I won't conform to your system
I'd rather die

[Chorus]
I'll burn it down just to watch it go
I'll burn it down so everybody knows
I'll burn it down just to see it torched
Burn it down—I hate it to the core

[Verse 2]
Think you're a martyr
Not hard to see
You want to rule the fucking world
You got to get through me
Your iron fist will be broken
No soul to sell
You think I'll burn for my actions?
See you in hell
You might also like[Chorus]
Burn it down—I do it for myself
Burn it down—for me and no one else
I burn it down just to watch it fall
Burn it down—I hate you fucking all

[Solo]

[Chorus]
I'll burn it down just to watch it go
I'll burn it down so everybody knows
I burn it down just to see it torched
I burn it down—I hate it to the coreEmbed
