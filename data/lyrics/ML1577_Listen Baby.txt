1 ContributorListen Baby Lyrics[Verse 1]
Listen, baby
I can't get you off of my mind
Oh, precious darlin'
It's just a matter of time
Before we get together
And I promise you
I'll make right
There'll be no doubt, honey

[Pre-Chorus]
Please try and understand
I wanna be your man

[Chorus]
Oh, listen, baby (Oh yes)
Listen, darlin' (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
My sweet baby
Seems no matter what I do
Mowin' the lawn, gassin' my car
I'm still thinking of you
Girl, it's a mystery
One that won't let me be
I got it bad
And it's a good thing, honey
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Please try and understand
I wanna be your man

[Chorus]
Oh, listen, baby (Oh baby, baby, baby, baby)
Listen, darlin' (Hear me now)

[Bridge]
As I hear the tick, tock of the clock upon the wall
I know that time's moving on and this is my wake up call
And it's time to make some decisions
And I know that it's you that I want
No more hesitation, girl, and no more being nonchalant
My old life is through (My old life is through)
And with this ring I promise you â€” I'm yours

[Chorus]
Listen, baby (I'm yours, yeah)
Listen, darlin' (Ooh)

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Listen, baby (You look so good)
Listen, darlin' (Not to be misunderstood - you see, I love you)
Listen, baby (Yes, I do, ooh, I love you)
Listen, darlin' (Girl, just sit on down)
Listen, baby
Listen, darlin' (Just relax, pull off your shoes)
Listen, baby (Ooh, let the music groove)
Listen, darlin' (Oh, don't stop now)
Listen, baby (Ooh, let the music groove)
Listen, darlin' (Yeah, yeah)Embed
