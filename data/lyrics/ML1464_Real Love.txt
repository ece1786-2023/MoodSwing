All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waitin' for you

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waitin' for love

[Pre-Chorus: John Lennon]
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

[Chorus: John Lennon]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waitin' for love

[Verse 4: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing

[Pre-Chorus: John Lennon]
Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone
