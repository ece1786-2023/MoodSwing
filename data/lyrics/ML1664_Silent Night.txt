4 ContributorsSilent Night Lyrics[Verse 1: Bing Crosby]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2: Guardsmen Quartet]
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

[Verse 3: Bing Crosby & Guardsmen Quartet]
Silent night, holy night (Mmm)
Child of heaven, oh how bright (Mmm)
Thou did smile when thou was born (Mmm)
Blessed be that happy morn (Mmm)
All of heaven rejoice (Ahh)
All of heaven rejoice (Ahh)You might also likeEmbed
