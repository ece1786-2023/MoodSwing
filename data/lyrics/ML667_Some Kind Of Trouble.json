 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsSome Kind of Trouble LyricsLate one night, I heard a knock on my door\nTo no surprise, it was my landlord\nHe notified me I was late with the rent\nWhat do you do with your last dollar spent?\n\nYou got trouble\nSome kind of trouble\n\nI called up my baby for a little advice\n'Cause my sugar baby always treats me so nice\nI had a funny feelin' he was not alone\nWhen I heard another voice whisper \"hang up the phone\"\n\nI got trouble\nSome kind of trouble\nTrouble in my heart, trouble on my mind\nThere never any trouble for me to find\nSome kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)\n\nI went to my boss\nSaid, \"I need a little time\nTo work on this poor old broken heart of mine.\"\nHe said, \"I'd like to help you.  I've been there before\nThe problem is, girl, you don't work here no more\n\nYou got trouble\nSome kind of trouble.\"\nTrouble in my heart, trouble on my mind\nThere's never any trouble for me to find\nSome kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)\nI got trouble\nSee Tanya Tucker LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also likeI was down around low as a body can be\nSo I talked to my preacher about prayin' for me\nHe smiled and he said, \"Child, you're not alone\n'Cause all God's children got to deal with their own trouble\n\nSome kind of trouble.\"\nTrouble in my heart, trouble on my mind\nThere's never any trouble for me to find\nSome kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)\nSome kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)\nSome kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)\nTrouble in my heart, trouble on my mind\n(Some kind of trouble.)\nNever any trouble for me to find.  (Some kind of trouble.)\nTrouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)\nWe got trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)\nSome kind of troubleEmbed"
