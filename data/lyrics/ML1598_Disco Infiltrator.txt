But all I know, is all I know
Is the disco infiltrator fo' sho
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it
Stop, you can't believe, what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh stupid me, oh stupid me
But still we want it

[Chorus]
Stop, we can't shake the waist
Stop, you've got to shake the waist

[Verse 2]
Stop, what you've been told, is what you're told
Is the disco infiltrator gone cold
Oh stupid you, I bet' told the truth
But you don't want it no!
Stop, you make me frown your little town
You run the disco infiltrator on down
Oh stupid you, oh stupid me
And we deserve it

[Chorus]
Stop, you can't take the waste
Stop, you've got to shake your waist

Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time

[Verse 3]
But all I know, is all I know
Is the disco infiltrator fo' sho
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it
Stop, you can't believe, what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh stupid me, oh stupid me
But still we want it

[Chorus]
Stop, you can't shake your waist
Stop, you've got to shake your waist
Stop, you can't shake your waist
Stop, you've got to shake your waist

[Bridge]
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
