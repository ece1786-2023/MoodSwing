7 ContributorsYoung Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
They say for every boy and girl
There's just one love in this whole world
And I know I've found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace
Tells me no one could take your place
Ever in my heart

[Chorus]
Young love, first love (You're my love, you're my love)
Filled with true devotion
Young love, our love (You're my love, you're my love)
We share with deep emotion

[Verse 2]
Just one kiss from your sweet lips
Will tell me that your love is real
And I can feel that it's true
We will vow to one another
There will never be another
Love for you or for me

[Chorus]
Young love, first love (You're my love, you're my love)
Filled with true devotion
Young love, our love (You're my love, you're my love)
We share with deep emotionYou might also like1Embed
