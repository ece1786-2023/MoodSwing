I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
There is no sickness, toil nor danger
In that fair land to which I go

[Chorus]
I'm goin' home to see my mother
I'm goin' home, no more to roam
I am just goin' over Jordan
I am just goin' over home

[Verse 2]
I know dark clouds will hover o'er me
I know my pathway is rough and steep
But golden fields lie out before me
Where weary eyes no more will weep

[Chorus]
I'm goin' home to see my father
I'm goin' home, no more to roam
I am just goin' over Jordan
I am just goin' over home

[Verse 3]
I'll soon be free from every trial
This form shall rest beneath the sod
I'll drop the cross of self-denial
And enter in that home with God
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm goin' home to see my Savior
I'm goin' home, no more to roam
I am just goin' over Jordan
I am just goin' over home2Embed
