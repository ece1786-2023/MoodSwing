Everything to me
When she was my girl
When she was my girl

I held her near
Told her how much I cared
When she was my girl
When she was my girl

When she was my girl
There was laughter and loving in my world
Everyday
When she was my girl
Oh what joy she would bring
Now I've lost everything
She's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

I spend the night
Dreaming how she used to be
When she was my girl
When she was my girl

[Instrumental Break]

When she was my girl
There was laughter and loving in my world
Yes it was
Cause she was my girl
Oh what joy she would bring
Now I've lost everything
She's gone, my big legged girl is gone

Everything to me
When she was my girl
When she was my girl

She, she's my girl
She's so foxy can't you see
And this girl belongs to me
She's my girl
When we walk down the street
I would tell everyone we meet
This is my girl
She, she was my girl
I loved, I loved ...Embed
