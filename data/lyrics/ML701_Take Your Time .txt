3 ContributorsTake Your Time Lyrics[Intro: Al Green & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Just you take your time, ooh ooh
Just you take your time

[Verse 1: Corinne Bailey Rae]
Do you remember when
We used to take our time
You'd write me a letter, baby
And I'd wait for you all night, oh
Now it seems everyone's rushing around, including you and I
I wanna take a little time
Just to fall in love again
'Cause they're telling me...

[Chorus: Al Green & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Just you take your time (No hurry, baby)
Just you take your time

[Verse 2: Al Green]
When I think about yesterday
Everything was easy
Everything was okay
Now everything is going fast
You're the best thing I ever had
Ah, and losing you
Ah, it'd make me, make me
That would make me feel so bad, hey, hey
Would you help me saying...
You might also like[Chorus: Al Green & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Just you take your time
Just you take your time

[Bridge: Al Green]
Sing low and take it slow
I'm inclined to agree
'Cause ain't nobody living
Can try to hurry me

[Outro: Al Green & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Just you take your time
Just you take your time
Just you take your time (No need to hurry, baby)
Just you take your time (I don't wanna really hurry you, baby)
Just you take your time (There's no rush, baby)
Just you take your time (All the time in the world for you, baby)Embed
