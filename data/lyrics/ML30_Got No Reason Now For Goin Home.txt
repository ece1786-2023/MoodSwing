Got no reason now for goin' home
All my reason's now she is gone
Got no one there to talk to
And even though I know I ought to
Got no reason now for goin' home

[Verse 1]
Once I had every reason a man could want
For going home and making love, but now I don't
So I end up in here each night sitting and a-thinking
Missing her, hurting so and drinking

[Chorus]
Got no reason now for goin' home
All my reason's now she is gone
Got no one there to talk to
And even though I know I ought to
Got no reason now for goin' home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
It's so hard now just knowing there's another
That she's out with him knowing that I love her
So I end up in here each night sitting and a-thinking
Missing her, hating him and drinking

Got no reason now for goin' home
All my reason's now she is gone
Got no one there to talk to
And even though I know I ought to
Got no reason now for goin' homeEmbed
