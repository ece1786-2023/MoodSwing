Why go home?\nWhy go home?\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe seems to be stronger but what they want her to be is weak\nShe could play pretend, she could join the game, boy\nShe could be another clone\nOoh! Ah! Ah yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy go home? Why go home?\nWhy go home? Why go home?\nWhat you taught (Why go home?)\nPut me here (Why go home?)\nDon't come visit (Why go home?)\nMother, sing me (Why go home?)\n\n[Guitar Solo]\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhy go home? Why go home?\nWhy go home? Why go home?\nWhat you taught me (Why go home?)\nPut me here (Why go home?)\nDon't come visit (Why go home?)\nMother, mother, yeah (Why go home?)\nWhy go home? Why go home?\nWhy go home? Why go home?\nWhy go home? Why go home?\nWhy go home?\nWhy!1Embed"
