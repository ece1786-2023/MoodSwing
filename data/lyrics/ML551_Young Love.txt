4 ContributorsYoung Love Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh-hoo, hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I remember back in school
When I first laid my eyes on you
I saw your smile and knew right then and there
You reached out and touched my hand
And two became just one person
No one could have stopped our love affair

[Pre-Chorus]
But lately we can't even see each other, no
Without acting just like distant lovers
(Distant lovers, lovers)
We've even took to fighting under covers
What a shame, baby — who's to blame?

[Chorus]
Young love (Young love)
Why you wanna grow old on me now?
Young love (Young love)
Why you wanna grow old on me now?
Don't say goodbye my love, no, no, no, baby
Just one more try, young love
You might also like[Verse 2]
I remember promises
The way I'd feel when we'd caress
I can't imagine where young love went wrong
You said that you needed me
But where is the sincerity?
I, I guess that with our love that too has flown

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause lately we can't even touch each other
Without acting just like distant lovers
(Distant lovers, lover)
We've even took to fighting under covers
What a shame, baby — who's to blame?

[Chorus]
Young love (Young love)
Why you wanna grow old on me now?
Young love (Young love)
Why you wanna grow old on me now?
Don't say goodbye my love, no, no, no, baby
Just one more try, young love

[Refrain]
Do you remember the young love?
Do you remember the love we shared?
Do you remember the young love?
Do you remember the love we shared? (When love was new, baby)
Do you remember the young love?
Do you remember the love we shared? (And we both were, too)
Do you remember the young love? (Sugar)
Do you remember the love we shared? (When love was new)
Do you remember the young love? (Baby)
Do you remember the love we shared? (And we both were, too)
Do you remember the young love? (Sugar)
Do you remember the love we shared? (Listen to me)
[Outro]
Don't you think we ought to give it one more try?
We've come too far to be saying
(We've come too far to be saying) Bye
(Young love)
Give it on more try (Young love)
Ooh, don't you remember, baby? (Young love)
Young love was much better (Young love)
Ooh, my love (Young love)
Why you wanna grow old on me?
Why you wanna keep me in misery? (Young love)
Why you wanna say goodbye? (Young love)
Why you want to make me cry, baby? (Young love)
Young love, my love, your love
Why you wanna say goodbye? (Young love)
Why you want to make me cry, baby? (Young love)
I'm cryin', baby
I'm cryin', baby (Young love)
I'm cryin', young love
I'm cryin', young love (Young love)
I'm cryin', young love
I'm cryin', young love (Young love, young love)
Don't say goodbye
