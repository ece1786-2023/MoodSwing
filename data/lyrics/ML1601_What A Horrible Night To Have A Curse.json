 "lyrics": "16 ContributorsWhat a Horrible Night to Have a Curse LyricsThis twisted, wretched place shadowed by the utmost darks of hell\nIn dreams of black, beyond the bounds of a withered witch's spell\nWhere the doors surely are locked when the sun threatens to wane\nWhere shamblers dwell in dim moon light beyond the warmth of day\nLiars line the roads at dawn\nWatchful eyes are upon you held\nSacred weapons to the sacred revealed to be unleashed its the council of hell\nBlood flows down the streets at night where wolves cry out for flesh\nWhere a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby with the forms of the walking dead\nUnholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate\nDriven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks\nThe undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds\nThey dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck\nHis spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land\nFreeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man\nInto the tower, never go; the horrors multiply\nThe gears can mince the strongest ones, leaving heroes paralyzed\nThe rivers flow with poison\nThe sands swallow you whole\nThe ghouls that roam this darkened wood are thirsting for your throat\n\nUnholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate\nDriven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks\nThe undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds\nThey dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck\nHis spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land\nFreeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of manYou might also like3Embed"
