 "lyrics": "35 ContributorsLocomotive Breath Lyrics[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nIn the shuffling madness\nOf the locomotive breath\nRuns the all-time loser\nHeadlong to his death\nHe feels the piston scraping\nSteam breaking on his brow\n\n[Refrain]\nOld Charlie stole the handle\nAnd the train it won't stop going\nNo way to slow down\nOh-oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe sees his children jumping off\nAt the stations - one by one\nHis woman and his best friend\nIn bed and having fun\nHe's crawling down the corridor\nOn his hands and knees\n\n[Refrain]\nOld Charlie stole the handle and\nThe train it won't stop going\nNo way to slow down\nHey-hey\nSee Jethro Tull LiveGet tickets as low as $81You might also like[Flute Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHe hears the silence howling\nCatches angels as they fall\nAnd the all-time winner\nHas got him by the balls\nOh, he picks up Gideon's Bible\nOpen at page one\n\n[Refrain]\nI said, God, he stole the handle and\nThe train it won't stop goin'\nNo way to slow down\nNo way to slow down\nNo way to slow down\nNo way to slow down\nNo way to slow down\nNo way to slow down3Embed"
