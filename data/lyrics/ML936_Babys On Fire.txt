3 ContributorsBaby’s on Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Her love is red hot when she comes undone
Never thought gettin' burned could be so much fun
Always comin' up with something new
Yeah, that woman taught me a thing or two

[Chorus]
She's on fire
My baby's on fire

[Verse 2]
We go out driving in my 6.6, yeah
Bypass the city, head straight for the sticks
Shut off the lights, turn off the key
No sooner set the brake, she jumps on top of me

[Chorus]
She's on fire
My baby's on fire

[Bridge]
Now let it burn
Ooh, yeah
I like it hot

[Chorus]
She's on fire
My baby's on fire
You might also like[Verse 3]
No time for friends, no time for rest
Straight home from school, she starts to get undressed
It's five below but it's hot down here, ooh
I get so hot every time she comes near
Turned on to love like it's the latest style
I get response from just a look with a smile
She's like a bomb that's about to explode
Just one touch and she begins to unload

[Chorus]
She's on fire, woo
My baby's on fire, oh yeah
She takes me higher
My baby's on fire, ow
She's on fire
My baby's on fire, yeah, I like it hot
She's on fire, woo
My baby's on fire
Oh, now let it burn, ow
Oh yeahEmbed
