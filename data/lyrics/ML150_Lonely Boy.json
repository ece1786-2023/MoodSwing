Just what we learned\nWe'll dress him up warmly and we'll send him to school\nIt'll teach him how to fight, to be nobody's fool\"\n\n[Chorus]\nOh!\nOh! What a lonely boy?\nOh! What a lonely boy?\nOh! What a lonely boy?\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn the summer of '53, his mother brought him a sister\nAnd she told him: \"We must attend to her needs, she's so much younger than you\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWell, he ran down the hall and he cried\nOh! How could his parents have lied?\nWhen they said he was their only son\nHe thought he was their only one\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nOh!\nOh! What a lonely boy?\nOh! What a lonely boy?\nOh! What a lonely boy?\n\n[Bridge]\nGoodbye Mama!\nGoodbye you!\nGoodbye Papa!\nI'm pushing on through!\n\n[Verse 3]\nHe left home on a winter day, 1969\nAnd he hoped to find all the love he had lost in that earlier time\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nWell, his sister grew up\nAnd she married a man\nHe gave her a son\nAh, yes! A lovely son\nThey dressed him up warmly\nThey sent him to school\nIt taught him how to fight\nTo be nobody's fool\n[Chorus]\nOh!\nOh! What a lonely boy?\nOh! What a lonely boy?\nOh! What a lonely boy?\n\n[Outro]\nWhoa-whoa-whoa!\nOh! What a lonely boy?\nOh! What a lonely boy?\nOh! What a lonely boy?1Embed"
