5 ContributorsSave My Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now there's something coming through the air that softly reminds me
Tonight I'll park out on the hill and wait until they find me
Here slippin' through the ether, a voice is comin' through
So keep me in your heart tonight and I'll save my love for you

[Verse 2]
So turn up your radio and darlin', dial me in close
Ridin' on the airwaves and we're travelin' coast to coast
Over river and highway your voice comes clear and true
Though we're far apart tonight, I'll save my love for you

[Bridge]
Hold me in your arms and our doubts won't break us
If we open up our hearts, love won't forsake us
Let's let the music take us and carry us home

[Verse 3]
There's a prayer comin' through the air like a shot straight through my heart
Tearin' open the evening sky, tearin' me apart
Now I'll ride that signal down the line 'til I'm home again with you
So turn up your radio and I'll save my love for you
Turn up your radio and I'll save my love for youSee Bruce Springsteen LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also likeEmbed
