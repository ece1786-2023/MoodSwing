6 ContributorsSaved by Zero Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe someday
Saved by zero
I'll be more together
Stretched by fewer
Thoughts that leave me
Chasing after
My dreams disown me
Loaded with danger

[Chorus]
So, maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)

[Verse 2]
Holding on to
Words that teach me
I will conquer
Space around me

[Chorus]
So, maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)

Saved by zero...
Saved by zero...

[Chorus]
So, maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Who needs to win (saved by zero)
