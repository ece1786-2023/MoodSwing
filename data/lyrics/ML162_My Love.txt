And when I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood, it's in the hands of my love
And my love does it good

[Chorus]
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

[Verse 2]
And when the cupboard's bare
I'll still find something there with my love
It's understood, it's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good

[Chorus]
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

[Bridge]
Oh oh, I love, oh oh, my love
Only my love holds the other key to me
Oh oh, my love, oh oh, my love
Only my love does it good to me

Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

[Verse 3]
Don't ever ask me why
I never say goodbye to my love
It's understood, it's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good, woah

[Chorus]
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

[Outro]
Oh oh, I love, oh oh, my love
Only my love does it good to me
Wo, wo, wo, wo
Wo oh, wo oh, wo5Embed
