4 ContributorsFree Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm floating in the blimp a lot
I feel the feeling I forgot

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Of swimming weightless in the womb
Or bouncing gently 'round the room
In a minute I'll be free
And you'll be splashing in the sea

[Verse 2]
I feel no curiosity
I see the path ahead of me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In a minute I'll be free
And you'll be splashing in the sea
We'll hear a tiny cry
As the ship goes sliding by

[Chorus]
