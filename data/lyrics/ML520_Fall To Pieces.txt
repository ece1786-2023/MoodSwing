It's been a long year
Since you've been gone
I've been alone here
I've grown old

[Pre-Chorus]
I fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling

[Chorus]
Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces

[Verse 2]
I keep a journal of memories
I'm feeling lonely, I can't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
I fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling

[Chorus]
Every time I’m falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I’m falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I’m falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
You might also like[Bridge]
All the years I've tried
With more to go
Will the memories die
I'm waiting
Will I find you
Can I find you
We're falling down
I'm falling

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Every time I’m falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I’m falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I’m falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I’m falling down
All alone I fall to pieces4Embed
