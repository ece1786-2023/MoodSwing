17 ContributorsSomeday You Will Be Loved Lyrics[Verse 1]
I once knew a girl in the years of my youth
With eyes like the summer, all beauty and truth
But in the morning I fled, left a note and it read:
"Someday you will be loved"

[Verse 2]
I cannot pretend that I felt any regret
'Cause each broken heart will eventually mend
And as the blood runs red down the needle and thread
Someday you will be loved

[Chorus]
You'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs, like I never occurred
'Cause someday you will be loved

[Verse 3]
You may feel alone when you're falling asleep
And every time tears roll down your cheeks
But I know your heart belongs to someone you've yet to meet
And someday you will be loved

[Chorus]
You'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs, like I never occurred
But someday you will be loved
You might also like[Chorus]
You'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs, like I never occurred
And someday you will be loved
And someday you will be loved2Embed
