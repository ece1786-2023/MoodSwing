The more you ignore me, the closer I get
You're wasting your time
The more you ignore me, the closer I get
You're wasting your time

[Verse 1]
I will be in the bar with my head on the bar
I am now a central part of your mind's landscape
Whether you care or do not
Yeah, I've made up your mind

[Chorus]
The more you ignore me, the closer I get
You're wasting your time
The more you ignore me, the closer I get
You're wasting your time

[Verse 2]
Beware, I bear more grudges than lonely high court judges
When you sleep, I will creep into your thoughts
Like a bad debt that you can't pay
Take the easy way and give in, yeah, and let me in

[Bridge]
Oh, let me in
Oh, let me, let me in
It's war, it's war, it's war, it's war
It's war, war, war, war, war

Ah, the closer I get
Ah, you're asking for it
Ah, the closer I get
Ah, the closer I1Embed
