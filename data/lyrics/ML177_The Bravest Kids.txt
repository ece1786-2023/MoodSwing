5 ContributorsThe Bravest Kids LyricsThe teleprompter is read
By the telegenic dead
And it goes across the nation
There ain't no war information

The bravest kids I know
Are the ones that gotta go
Fighting over there
The bravest kids I know
Are the ones that gotta go
Fighting over there

All channels pre-empted
Another socialite gonna get arrested
Pop culture transaction
Taken over my television

The bravest kids I know
Are the ones that gotta go
Fighting over there
The bravest kids I know
Are the ones that gotta go
Fighting over thereYou might also likeEmbed
