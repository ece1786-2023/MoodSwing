8 ContributorsLouder Than Hell Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some like the violence
Some like submission
Some use aggression
Some use a bullet in the head to be brave

Some like evil
Well, some need the power
Some bleed in vain
Some get a bullet in the head instead

[Bridge]
Some got the go
Some play the role
Some scream out in horror just for show
Some have no reason
Some have no hope
Some like it loud
We like it loud, we like it loud

[Chorus]
We like it louder
Louder than hell
Loud
Some like it, ooh, some like it
Ooh, some like it loud

Some got the honey
Some hold the pistol
Some need no money
Some hang on the string of obscene

[Bridge]
Some got the go
Some play the role
Some scream out in horror just for show
Some have no reason
Some have no hope
Some like it loud
We like it loud, we like it loud

[Chorus]
We like it louder
Louder than hell
Loud
Some like it, ooh, some like it
Ooh, some like it loud

Loud
Louder than hell
Loud
Louder than hell
Loud
Louder than hell
Loud
Some like it, ooh, some like it
Ooh, some like it loudEmbed
