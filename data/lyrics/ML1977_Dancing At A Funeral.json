 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsDancing At a Funeral LyricsNow's not the time to be so sad and mournful\nWe are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away\nSo, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying\nWe are laughing and we're crying every single day\n\nStrange, but not surprisin', nor is it unfamiliar\nHow it takes a death like this to bring us together\nYou know you'll always be my flesh and blood;\nI could never do you wrong\nAnd the one who was gone for so long is coming home\n\nAlright...\n\nNow's not the time to be so sad and mournful\nWe are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away\nSo, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying;\nWe are laughing and we're crying every single day\n\nWe are getting older at the blink of an eye\nSo, don't let the moment pass you by\nI don't believe there is a greater love, one of patience and pain\nThan the love between a mama and her children\n\nIn the procession down to the lighthouse\nWe hear the crashing of the waves, and the mistakes we made\nYou know that we are not the only ones, so, we can have some fun\nHave some, have some, have some, have some fun\nYou might also likeNow's not the time to be so sad and mournful\nWe are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away\nSo, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying;\nWe are laughing and we're crying every single day\nEvery single day\n\n[Is] not the time to be so, to be so sad\nWe are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away\nSo, so, so, don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying\nWe are laughing and we're crying every single day\nEvery single dayEmbed"
