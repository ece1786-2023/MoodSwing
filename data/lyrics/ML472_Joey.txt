14 ContributorsJoey Lyrics[Verse 1]
Joey, baby
Don't get crazy
Detours, fences
I get defensive

[Chorus 1]
I know you've heard it all before
So I don't say it anymore
I just stand by and let you fight your secret war
And though I used to wonder why
I used to cry 'til I was dry
Still sometimes I get a strange pain inside
Oh, Joey, if you're hurting so am I

[Verse 2]
Joey, honey
I've got the money
All is forgiven
Listen, listen

[Chorus 2]
But if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you
And when you said I scared you, well, I guess you scared me too
But we got lucky once before
And I don't wanna close the door
And if you're somewhere out there passed out on the floor
Oh, Joey, I'm not angry anymore

[Chorus 2]
And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you
And when you said I scared you, well, I guess you scared me too
But if it's love you're looking for
Then I can give a little more
And if you're somewhere drunk and passed out on the floor
Oh, Joey, I'm not angry anymore

[Outro]
Angry anymore
