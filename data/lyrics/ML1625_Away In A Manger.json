 "lyrics": "1 ContributorAway in a Manger LyricsSleep little baby sleep\n\nAway in a manger, no crib for a bed\nThe little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head\nThe stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay\nThe little Lord Jesus, asleep in the hay\n\nAnd I welcome You in my heart\nI pray that we will never part\nThis love You gave me\nIs shining for the whole world to see\nShining for the whole world to see\n\nThe cattle are lowing, the sweet Baby awakes\nBut little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes\nI love You, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky\nAnd stay right by my side till morning is nigh\n\nAnd I welcome You in my heart\nI pray that we will never part\nThis love that You gave me\nIs shining for the whole world to see\nShining for the whole world to see\n\nHear the words when\nDarkness seems everywhere\nPeople hurting\nNo one seems to care\nWe need Your love\nTo shine down on me\nYou might also likeBe near me, Lord Jesus, I ask You to stay\nClose by me forever, and love me, I pray\nBless all the dear children in Thy tender care\nAnd take us to heaven to live with You there\n\nAnd I, I welcome You in my heart\nI pray that You will never part\nThis love You gave me\nIs shining\n\nFor unto us a child is born\nEmmanuel\nPrince of Peace\nEverlasting Father\nWhat a wonderful King\nKeep shining so the whole world can see\nEmmanuel\n\nSleep little Jesus, sleep\nSleep little Jesus, sleep\nEmmanuel\nSleep little Jesus, sleep\nSleep little Jesus, sleepEmbed"
