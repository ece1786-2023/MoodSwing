Motherless children have a hard time when the mother is gone
Motherless children have a hard time when the mother is gone
Motherless children have a hard time
There's all that weeping and all that crying
Motherless children have a hard time when the mother is gone

[Verse 2]
Father will do the best he can when the mother is gone
Father will do the best he can when the mother is gone
Father will do the best he can
But there's so many things he just don't understand
Motherless children have a hard time when the mother is gone

[Verse 3]
People say a sister will do when the mother is gone
People say a sister will do when the mother is gone
People say a sister will do
But she'll get married, turn her back on you
Motherless children have a hard time when the mother is gone

[Verse 4]
Friends will treat you like your mother will when your mother is gone
Friends will treat you like your mother will when your mother is gone
Friends will tell you what to do
Then they'll turn their back on you
Motherless children have a hard time when their mother is goneYou might also likeEmbed
