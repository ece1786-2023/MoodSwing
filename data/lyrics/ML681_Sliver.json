Grandma, take me home!\nGrandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!\nGrandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!\nGrandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!\n\n[Verse 2]\nHad to eat my dinner there\nMashed potatoes and stuff like that\nI couldn't chew my meat too good\n\n[Chorus]\nGrandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!\nGrandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!\nGrandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!\nGrandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe said, \"Why don't you stop your crying?\nGo outside and ride your bike\"\nThat's what I did, I killed my toe!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nGrandma, take me home!
