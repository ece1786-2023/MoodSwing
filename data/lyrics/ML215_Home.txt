26 ContributorsHome Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll be coming home just to be alone
'Cause I know you're not there
And I know that you don't care
I can hardly wait to leave this place

[Chorus]
No matter how hard I try, you're never satisfied
This is not our home, I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear, even when you're here
This is not my home, I think I'm better off alone

[Post-Chorus]
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home
(Home)

[Verse 2]
By the time you come home, I'm already stoned
You turn off the TV and you scream at me
I can hardly wait 'til you get off my case

[Chorus]
No matter how hard I try, you're never satisfied
This is not our home, I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear, even when you're here
This is not my home, I think I'm better off alone
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home
(Home)

[Bridge]
I'm better off alone

[Chorus]
No matter how hard I try, you're never satisfied
This is not our home, I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear, even when you're here
This is not my home, I think I'm better off alone

[Post-Chorus]
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home11Embed
