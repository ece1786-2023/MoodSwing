12 ContributorsWasting Time Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
And I'm just a waste of her energy
And she's just a-wastin' my time, mhmm
So why don't we get together
And we could waste everything tonight
And we could waste, and we could waste it all tonight
Yeah, and we could waste, and we could waste it all

[Verse 2]
And I don't pretend to know what you know, nah, nah
Now please don't pretend to know what's on my mind
If we already knew everything that everybody knows
We would have nothing to learn tonight
And we would have nothing to show tonight

[Chorus]
Oh, but everybody thinks that everybody knows
About everybody else, nobody knows
Anything about themselves
'Cause they're all worried about everybody else, yeah
Yeah, mhmm
Oh

[Chorus]

About everybody else, nah, nah, nobody knows
Anything about themselves
'Cause they're all worried about everybody else, yeah
