3 ContributorsTalk About That Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's a lie that you said a goodbye
It's the empty side of the bed
It's the kid who pretends he loves to hold her hand
It's why he skipped the dance
It's what they say the Bible says
So who the hell could understand?

[Verse 2]
It's a train from New York too late
To the hospital ward when your knees hit the floor
It's your whole damn life inside a drawer
'Cause your parents got divorced
It's your dad's apartment door
Can't say I love you anymore

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know why we don't talk about that
We're all growing up just a littlе too fast
We all have words we can't say back
And look too long at a photograph
Wе all got something that we think we lack
Holding onto bags that we can't unpack
All need help, but we don't ask
Maybe we should talk about that

It's youth, that rush, it's strange
It's all too much change too fast
It's all the friends you thought you had
And the burn of summer's past
How both a bottle on the desk
And a heart are made of glass

[Chorus]
No, I don't know why we don't talk about that
We're all growing up just a little too fast
We all have words we can't say back
And look too long at a photograph
All got something that we think we lack
Holding onto bags that we can't unpack
All need help, but we don't ask
Yeah, maybe we should talk about that

[Bridge]
Oh, I just wanna talk about that
Oh, can we talk about it?
'Cause if I'm speaking honestly
Yeah, I need you like you need me, yeah, oh
Yeah, if I'm speaking honestly
Yeah, I need you like you need me, darling
I do need you, darling, yeah
[Verse 3]
It's a plot, it's a grave all you got
It's the dash between the dates what a cost
It's what you make before it stops
Why is it so hard to say
That life can be a lot
And everyone's afraid?

[Outro]
No, I don't know why we don't talk about that
No, I don't know why we don't talk about that
No, I don't know why we don't talk about that
No, I don't know why1Embed
