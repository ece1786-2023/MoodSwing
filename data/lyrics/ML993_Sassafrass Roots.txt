Roaming 'round your house, wasting your time
No obligation, just wasting your time
So why are you alone wasting your time?
When you could be with me, wasting your time?

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a waste like you
With nothin' else to do
May I waste your time too?

[Verse 2]
Warding off regrets, wasting your time
Smoking cigarettes, wasting your time
I'm just a parasite wasting your time
Applying myself to wasting your time

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a waste like you
With nothin' else to do
May I waste your time too?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
So why are you alone, wasting your time?
When you could be with me, wasting your time?

Well, I'm a waste like you
With nothing else to do
May I waste your time too?

[Outro]
May I waste your time too?
May I waste your time too?
May I waste your time too?8Embed
