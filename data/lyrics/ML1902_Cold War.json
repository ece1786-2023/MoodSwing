It's a cold, cold war...\nDo you?\nDo you?\nDo you..ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh\nIt's a cold, cold\nYou better know what you're fighting for\n[Outro]\nBye bye bye bye, don't you cry when you say goodbye\nBye bye bye bye, don't you cry when you say goodbye\nBye bye bye bye, don't you cry when you say goodbye\nBye bye bye bye, don't you cry when you say goodbye8Embed"
