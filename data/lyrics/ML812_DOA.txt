3 ContributorsD.O.A. LyricsI ain't no mind control
I ain't no parasite
I never bring you joy
I'll never bring you fun

Dead on arrival
Dead with a gun
Dead on arrival

It's no fun
It's no fun
It's no fun
It's no fun

I sit alone in darkness
And thinking of my past
How long will this last
Cuz this worlds a piece of trash

Dead on arrival
Dead with a gun
Dead on arrival

It's no fun
It's no fun
It's no fun
It's no funYou might also like1Embed
