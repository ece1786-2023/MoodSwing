7 ContributorsPrelude to a Kiss Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you hear a song in blue
Like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

[Verse 2]
And if you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

[Bridge]
Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch

[Verse 3]
Oh, how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

[Instrumental Break]
You might also like[Bridge]
Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch

[Verse 4]
Oh, how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
My prelude to a kissEmbed
