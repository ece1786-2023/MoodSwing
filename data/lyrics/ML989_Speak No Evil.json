 "lyrics": "1 ContributorSpeak No Evil LyricsDon't go around spreading rumours\nEven if what you say is true\nBefore you go and tell your tales\nYou better think things true\n\nSo speak no evil, Evil won't happen to you\n\nI've been mad enough to kill someone\nBut I couldn't face the task\nSo I tried to shout them down\nWith this big mouth of mine\n\nSo speak no evil, evil will get you in time\n\nI've been about ..... that that shouldn't mess with you\nEvery time that I lied, you know I mean to tell the truth\nNo matter where I go , no matter what I do or say\nSomebody gonna telling me, when they oughtta back away\n\nWords thrown out in anger, always come back to haunt you\nOnce they go they told me, talk so hard to undo\nSo speak no evil, evil will come back to you\nBetter speak no evil, evil will come back to youYou might also likeEmbed"
