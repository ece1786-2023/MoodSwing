 "lyrics": "5 ContributorsBring Them To Light Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHe's a large and ugly giant monster, headless on my back\nThis urgent haste in my head\nMaterialized in this dark whole world\nNo one can help me there\nI know this pain has gone too far\nThe fear is now so loud\nKill a child I'm trying to protect myself\nAgainst your old controlled hate\nPollution of mind filled all the space and destroyed my light\nAt least mine were never allowed\n\n[Chorus]\nThe hardest thing for me is\nFacing the fear I live\nNo one can help me now it's under my heart\nI'll come to know the living\nMy demons are inside\nI'll bring them all to light\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wanted to hate, I wanted to die\nI wanted to see you sacrifice\nI had to deal with the fear you gave me\nBut you fucker never tried to help me\nI was jealous and I was scared\nNobody ever replaced my pain\nTo say I'm not evil, to tell I'm not bad\nToo late, I'm lost in human nature\nSee Apocalyptica LiveGet tickets as low as $63You might also like[Pre-Hook]x2\nLeave me be\nSet me free\nLeave me be\nSet me free\n\n[Chorus]\nThe hardest thing for me is\nFacing the fear I live\nNo one can help me now it's under my heart\nI'll come to know the living\nMy demons are inside\nI'll bring them all to light\n\n[Bridge]\nUnexpected yet expected, emerged from the dark I come to life\nTake everything if you give my horse it's head\nYou know me, you fear me\nAlways me knocking at your door, always around\nInsulted, disrespected, return to the dark into this life\nYou know me, you fear me x4\nYou know me, you fear me\n\n[Chorus]\nThe hardest thing for me is\nFacing the fear I live\nNo one can help me now it's under my heart\nI'll come to know the living\nMy demons are inside\nI'll bring them all to light1Embed"
