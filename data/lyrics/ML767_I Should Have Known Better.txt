5 ContributorsI Should Have Known Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
I should have known better with a guy like you
That I would love everything that you do, and I do
Hey hey hey, and I do

[Pre Chorus]
Whoa whoa, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

[Chorus]
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too
Oh oh, and when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

[Pre Chorus]
Whoa whoa, I, never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't' you see?
Oh

[Chorus]
That when I tell you that I love you, oh (Oh)
You're gonna say you love me too (Oh)
Oh, and when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You might also like[Outro]
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too1Embed
