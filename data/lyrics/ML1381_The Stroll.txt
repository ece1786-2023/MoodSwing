Come, let's Stroll
Stroll across the floor
Come, let's Stroll
Stroll across the floor
Now, turn around, baby
Let's Stroll once more

[Verse 2]
Feel so good
Take me by my hand
I feel so good
Take me by my hand
And let's go strollin'
In Wonderland

[Bridge]
Strollin', whoa yeah
I'm strollin'
I'm a-rock 'n' rollin'
Strollin'
Well, rock my soul
How I love to Stroll

[Verse 3]
There's my love
Strollin' in the door
There's my love
Strollin' in the door
Baby, let's go strollin'
By the candy store
