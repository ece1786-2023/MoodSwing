And she spoke words that would melt in your hands
And she spoke words of wisdom
To the basement, people, to the basement
Many surprises await you
In the basement, people, in the basement

[Chorus]
You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission
You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission

[Verse 2]
And she spoke words that would melt in your hands
And she spoke words of wisdom
To the basement, people, to the basement
Many surprises await you
In the basement, people, in the basement

[Chorus]
You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission
You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission
