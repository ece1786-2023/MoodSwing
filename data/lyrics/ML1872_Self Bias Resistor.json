Rise up!\nRise to fight, eliminate\nBurn your fuse to detonate\nThe human machines of hate\n\n[Chorus]\nAll these years they've tried to break you to your knees\nAnger scours right through your veins\nNow it's time to put an end to all the lies\nNow it's time to take control of your life\n\n[Verse 2]\nWake up! Rise up!\nOpen minds will dominate\nBurn your fuse to detonate\nThe human machines of hate\n\n[Chorus]\nAll these years they've tried to break you to your knees\nAnger scours right through your veins\nNow it's time to put an end to all the lies\nNow it's time to take control of your life\nLife\nLife\nLife\nSee Fear Factory LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like[Bridge]\nHypocrisy\nYou can't believe\nMachines of hate\nA disease that infiltrates\n\nPersist for resistance\nResist their insolence\nYou are a dissident\nBurn away conformity\n\nPersist for resistance\nResist their insolence\nYou are a dissident\nBurn away conformity\n\n[Chorus]\nAll these years they've tried to break you to your knees\nAnger scours right through your veins\nNow it's time to put an end to all the lies\nNow it's time to take control of your life\n\n[Outro]\nThey have tried to break you\nThey have tried to break you\nThey have tried to break you\nThey have tried to break you1Embed"
