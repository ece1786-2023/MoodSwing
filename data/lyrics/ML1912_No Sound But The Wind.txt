12 ContributorsNo Sound But the Wind (2009) Lyrics[Verse 1]
We can never go home
We no longer have one
I'll help you carry the load
I'll carry you in my arms
The kiss of the snow
The crescent moon above us
Our blood is cold and we're alone
But I'm alone with you

[Chorus]
Help me to carry the fire
We will keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
It will light our way forever

[Verse 2]
If I say, "Shut your eyes"
If I say, "Look away"
Bury your face in my shoulder
Think of a birthday
The things you put in your head
They will stay here forever
Our blood is cold and we're alone, love
But I'm alone with you
You might also like[Chorus]
Help me to carry the fire
We will keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
It will light our way forever
Help me to carry the fire
We will keep it alight together
Now help me to carry the fire
It will light up our way forever

[Bridge]
If I say, "Shut your eyes"
If I say, "Shut your eyes"
Bury me in surprise
When I say, "Shut your eyes, eyes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Help me to carry the fire
We will keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
It will light our way foreverEmbed
