6 ContributorsSilent Night Lyrics[Intro]
(Sleep in heavenly peace)
(Sleep in heavenly peace)

[Verse 1]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2]
(Silent night, holy night)
(Shepherds quake at the sight)
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born
