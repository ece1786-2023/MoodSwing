 "lyrics": "4 ContributorsYour Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI felt it first when I was younger\nA strange connection to the light\nI tried to satisfy the hunger\nI never got it right\nI never got it right\nSo I climbed a mountain and l built an altar\nLooked out as far as I could see\nAnd every day I'm getting older\nI'm runnin' outta dreams\nI'm runnin' outta dreams\n\n[Chorus]\nBut your love, your love\nThe only the thing that matters is your love\nYour love is all I have to give\nYour love is enough to light up the darkness\nIt's your love, your love\nAll I ever needed is your love\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know the effort I have given\nAnd you know exactly what it cost\nAnd though my innocence was taken\nNot everything is lost\nNot everything is lost (No)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBut your love, your love\nThe only the thing that matters is your love\nYour love is all I have to give\nYour love is enough to light up the darkness\nIt's your love, your love\nAll I ever needed is your love\n\n[Bridge]\nYou're the hope in the morning\nYou're the light when the night is falling\nYou're the song when my heart is singing\nIt's your love\nYou're the eyes to the blind man\nYou're the feet to the lame man walking\nYou're the sound of the people singing\nIt's your love, your love\n\n[Bridge]\nLove, your love I needed\nLove, your love I lean on\nNever ever seen such love before, you (Your Love)\nLove, your love I needed\nLove, your love I lean on\nNever ever seen such love before, you\n[Chorus]\nBut your love (Your love)\nYour love (Your love)\nThe only the thing that matters is your love (Your love)\nYour love (Your love) is all I have to give (Oh)\nYour love (Your love) is enough (Enough) to light up the darkness\nIt's your love (Your love)\nYour love (Your love)\nAll I ever needed is your love\n\n[Outro]\nYour love is all that I needed\nAll I ever needed is your love (Your love)\nYour love (Your love)\nAll I ever needed is your love\nYour love is all that I needed\nAll I ever needed is your love\nYour love is all that I needed\nIt's all I ever needed2Embed"
