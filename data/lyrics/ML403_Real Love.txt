5 ContributorsReal Love Lyrics
They say that it's a matter of trusting
Before love has a chance to begi-in
And it's never simple
Faithless hearts can cripple
And only a strong love survi-ives
I know they say that it's such a fine line
Between giving up and givi-ing in
Ahh, but once your heart's been in it
You just can't forget it
It's like nothing that you've felt in your li-i-ife
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our heart's celebra-ation
I love you, You know I love you too
Real love, not an imitation
Real love, you're my destina-ation
Baby, you and me, we got everything we need
We...
You are such a part of my life
That I can't remember me without you-ou
And we've had our nights, we've had our share of fights
But we never thought of givin' it u-u-up
Woh, you and I we must be dreamers
'Cause we're makin' all our dreams come true-ue
I could spend my life just holding you so tight
And never ever ge-et enou-ou-ough
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our heart's celebra-ation
I love you, You know I love you too
We got real love, not an imitation
Real love, you're my destina-ation
Baby, you and me, we got everything we need
We got real lo-ove
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our heart's celebra-ation
I love you, You know I love you too
Real love, not an imitation
Real love, you're my destina-ation
Baby, you and me, we got everything we need
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our heart's celebra-ation
I love you, You know I love you too
We got real love, not an imitation (fade)You might also likeEmbed
