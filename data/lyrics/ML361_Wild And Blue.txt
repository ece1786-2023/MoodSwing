5 ContributorsWild and Blue Lyrics[Verse 1]
Way across town a phone rings off the wall
If you know he ain't home, why do you keep calling?
You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's just making you wild and blue

[Chorus]
Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

[Verse 2]
In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your minds all made up and the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue

[Chorus]
Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

[Verse 3]
It's four in the morning and you're all alone
With no place to go, why don't you come home?
I'll be right here baby, waiting for you
I know you've been wild and blue

Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

[Outro]
Wild and blue
It's noEmbed
