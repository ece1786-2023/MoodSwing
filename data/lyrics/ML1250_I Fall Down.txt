5 ContributorsI Fall Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Julie says
John, I'm getting nowhere
I wrote this letter
Hope to get to someplace soon
I wanna get up
When I wake up
But when I get up
I fall down

[Verse 2]
Julie wake up
Julie tell the story
You wrote the letter
Said you were gonna get there someday
Gonna walk in the sun
And the wind and the rain
Never walk back again

[Chorus]
Now you fall down
You're falling down
You fall down
You fall down

[Verse 3]
Julie say something
Julie say you're sorry
You're gonna get better
You better not leave me here anyway
I wanna get up
When you wake up
But when I get up

I fall down
And I'm falling down
I fall down
I broke myself

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I fall, I fall down
I'm falling down
I fall down
When you fall down
When I'm falling down
Is when you're falling down
When you fall down
I fall down
I fall downEmbed
