 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsQueen Of The Silver Dollar Lyrics[Verse 1]\nShe arrives in all her splendor\nEach night at nine o'clock\nHer chariot is the crosstown bus\nThat stops right down the block\nNow the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in\nAnd the queen of the Silver Dollar's home again\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's the queen of the Silver Dollar\nShe rules a smokey kingdom\nScepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne\nNow the jesters flock around her trying to win her favors\nTo see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow her royal dress is satin\nIt's shabby and it's torn\nThe royal jewels are rhinestones\nThe shoes are scuffed and worn\nOf the many roads she's been down\nAnd the places that she's seen\nWell they all look at her and say God save the queen\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's the queen of the Silver Dollar\nShe rules a smokey kingdom\nScepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne\nNow the jesters flock around her trying to win her favors\nTo see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nNow the queen of the Silver Dollar\nIs not as haughty as she seems\nShe was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams\nBut there's a man who found her\nAnd he brought her to this world\nHe's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl\n\n[Chorus]\nYes I'm the queen of the Silver Dollar\nI rule a smokey kingdom\nMy scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne\nNow the jesters flock around my trying to win my favors\nTo see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home\n\nYes I'm the queen of the Silver Dollar\nI rule a smokey kingdom\nMy scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne\nNow the jesters flock around my trying to win my favors\nTo see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar homeEmbed"
