Pill overdose and I played it off
I seen the gate and I prayed to God
I threw some up but it wasn’t all
Medusa caught me I’m crumbling off
Pain in my side and I play it off
Shame in my eye I’m deflating off
Cowards way out make ‘em see you soft
That’s why I been dodging incoming calls
That’s why I been dodging incoming calls

[Verse]
Feelings they fleeting they come and go they wrap me up like a mummy, I come in gauze
Home’s where the hate is, you homies ‘til death or ‘til somebody fake it
My running start:
They want a mirror hold up
I need some niggas that post up
Not just somebody to post pics to they spam page when it’s going up
Probably a sign of the times
You want me to show you yourself
But how imma show you yourself
And I ain’t even close myself

[Outro]
Under the moonlight
Moonlight
Stars know everything
Stars know everything
Stars know everything
The stars know everything
Stars know everything
The stars know everything
The stars know everything
Everything
The stars know everything
Stars know everything
That we’ve done
That we’ve done
In the moonlight
The stars know everythingYou might also likeEmbed
