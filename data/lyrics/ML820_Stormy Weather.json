 "lyrics": "5 ContributorsStormy Weather LyricsDon't know why there's no sun up in the sky, stormy weather\nSince my gal and I ain't together, keeps raining all the time\n\nLife is bare, gloom and misery everywhere, stormy weather\nJust can't get my poor old self together\nI'm weary all the time, the time\nSo weary all the time\n\nWhen she went away the blues walked in and they met me\nIf she stays away, that old rocking chair's gonna get me\nAll I do is pray the Lord above will let me\nWalk in the sun once more\n\nCan't go on, everything I have is gone, stormy weather\nSince my gal and I ain't together\nKeeps raining all the time\nKeeps raining all the time\n\nCan't go on, everything I have is gone, stormy weather\nSince my gal and I ain't together\nKeeps raining all the time, the time\nKeeps raining all the timeYou might also likeEmbed"
