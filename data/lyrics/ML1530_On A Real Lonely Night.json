 "lyrics": "1 ContributorOn A Real Lonely Night LyricsYou've been out of my life sometime now\nSeem like a long, long while\nSometimes the thoughts of you\nBring tears to my eyes\n\nWhile the times that bring a smile\nI remember what you told me\nWe would always be close in our hearts\nMust be easy to sleep in another man's arms\nWe're so damn far apart\n\nOn a real lonely night\nI can almost hear you laughing\nJust making me a fool\nI can almost see your face\nOn a real lonely night\n\nThere's a picture of you hanging on my wall\nSuch a lovely girl\nSometimes I feel like breaking into pieces\nLike you did to my world\n\nOh, and other times I wanna hold her in my arms\nLike a ball in chain\nI look till I'm through loving you\nI can never love again\nYou might also likeOn a real lonely night\nI can almost hear you laughing\nJust making me a fool\nOn a real lonely night\nJust no way to pass the time\n\nI walk around and I talk to myself\nPretending that it's you\nI can almost see your face\n\nI can't hold you\nLike we used to do\n\nOn a real lonely night\nI can almost hear you laughing\nAnd feel your warm breath on my skin\nJust making me a fool\nOn a real lonely night\nJust no way to pass the time\n\nI walk around and I talk to myself\nPretending that it's you, yes, I do\nI can almost see your face\nI can almost see your face\n\nOn a real lonely night\nOn a real lonely night\nOn a real lonely night\nI can almost hear you laughingEmbed"
