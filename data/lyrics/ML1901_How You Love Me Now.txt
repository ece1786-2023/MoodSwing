5 ContributorsHow You Love Me Now Lyrics[Intro]
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
You were talkin' to her
But messin' with me
It's finally clear
You're blurring the lines
Are you disturbed?
Oh, now you care
Why do you race through my red lights?

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't understand?
I'll slow it down for you

[Chorus]
Tell me, how can you sleep?
How can you breathe?
Baby, tell me how
How you love me now (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
Tell me, how can you sleep?
How can you breathe?
I hate when you say
How you love me now (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)

Save; save it for her
I'm not gonna hear
Your reasons and "please-just-take-me-backs"
We never were right
Don't waste your breath
You crashed and you're on your own tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't understand?
I'll slow it down for you

[Chorus]
Tell me, how can you sleep?
How can you breathe?
Baby, tell me how
How you love me now (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
Tell me, how can you sleep?
How can you breathe?
I hate when you say
How you love me now (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)

[Bridge]
Lights out
I found out
My falling star
Goodbye
The sun rises here
There's no more you and I
[Pre-Chorus]
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Tell me, how can you sleep?
How can you breathe?
Baby, tell me how
How you love me now (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
Tell me, how can you sleep?
How can you breathe?
I hate when you say
How you love me now
How you love me now
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh-oh)
How you love me now
