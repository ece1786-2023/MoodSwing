7 ContributorsStranger in My House Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a silence here between us
I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There's some changes going on
I'm beginning to understand
When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

[Verse 2]
She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's alright
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know?
Or somebody she just met?
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed?
You might also like[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
(Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

[Verse 3]
Suspicions lead to questions
And questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination?
Or has her love turned into lies?

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
A stranger in my houseEmbed
