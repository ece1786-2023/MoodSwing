Are you ready?

[Verse 1: Jonathan Davis]
This place inside my mind
A place I like to hide

[Refrain: Jonathan Davis]
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind

[Verse 2: Jonathan Davis]
Another place I find
To escape the pain inside

[Refrain: Jonathan Davis]
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind

Deeper, and deeper, and deeper
As I journey to live a life that seems to be a lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner...
Self-esteem is low
How deep can I go in the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

[Chorus: Jonathan Davis & Head]
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind (I can see I'm going)
I can see, I can see I'm going blind (Going blind)
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind!

[Outro: Jonathan Davis]
I'm blind!
I'm blind!
I'm blind!
I'm blind!18Embed
