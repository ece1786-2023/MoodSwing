Fresh garbage
Look beneath your lid some morning
See those things you didn't quite consume
The world's a can for your fresh garbage

Look beneath your lid some morning
See those things you didn't quite consume
Your fresh garbage

Well, look beneath your lid some morning
See those things you didn't quite consume
The world's a can for your fresh garbage
