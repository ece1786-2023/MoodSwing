And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\nYou might also like[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you190Embed"
