(One more chance, one more chance, one more chance, one more chance)\nJust one more chance (Just one more chance)\nAnd I will be your love forever\nOne more chance, one more chance (One more chance, one more chance, one more chance, one more chance)\nOw!\nJust one more chance (Just one more chance)\nAnd I will be your love forever\nOne more chance, one more chance, ow! (One more chance, one more chance, one more chance, one more chance)\nJust one more chance (Just one more chance)\nAnd I will be your love forever\nOne more chance, one more chance, ow! (One more chance, one more chance, one more chance, one more chance)\nYou might also like[Outro]\nJust one more chance, just one more chance!\nBring it!Embed"
