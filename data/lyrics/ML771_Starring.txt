Shut me up with your long tube socks
They don't scream, "Hey, let's just be friends"
Look at both my inkwells brimming
I was much less understanding then

[Verse 2: Judah Dadone]
How many stars you think you possess?
How many in your butterfly net?
They'll be etched onto your forehead
You were so misunderstood back then

[Pre-Chorus 1: Judah Dadone]
But I think I get you now
I think I get you now

[Chorus: Judah Dadone, Freelance Whales]
This is me starring
In the stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In the stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare

[Verse 3: Judah Dadone]
Don't let the bathwater get too high
You will be a flood of porcelain
Lions clawed on inside
It's digging hard into your tiles

[Pre-Chorus 1: Judah Dadone]
And we're gonna flood this house
We're gonna flood this house

[Chorus: Judah Dadone, Freelance Whales]
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In the stranger's nightmare
[Vocalizing to riff]
This is me starring
In the stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmareEmbed
