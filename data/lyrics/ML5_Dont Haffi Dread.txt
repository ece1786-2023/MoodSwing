You don't ha fi dread to be Rasta
(Don't ha fi dread)
This is not a dreadlocks thing
Divine conception of the heart, well
You don't ha fi dread to be Rasta
(Don't ha fi dread)
This is not a dreadlocks thing
Divine conception of the heart, well
Oh, it's a life of a levity
Lived by the fathers of our history
Uphold the anciency and prophecy
Trust in the power of the Trinity, yeah
Got to believe in His Majesty
Oh yes, His lineage and divinity
The first step is serenity
Knowing one self's true royalty, yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't ha fi dread to be Rasta
(Don't ha fi dread)
This is not a dreadlocks thing
Divine conception of the heart, well
You don't ha fi dread to be Rasta, well
(Don't ha fi dread)
This is not a dreadlocks thing
Divine conception of the heart, well
Don't be afraid of Jah ever burning fire
Trust in Jah fire and you'll never get burn
The fire that reigns over heat, air and water
No water can put out Jah fire
Jah fire gonna lift Rasta higher
You don't ha fi dread to be Rasta, yeah
(Don't ha fi dread)
This is not a dreadlocks thing
Divine conception of the heart, well
You don't ha fi dread to be Rasta, yeah
(Don't ha fi dread)
This is not a dreadlocks thing
Divine conception of the heart
Don't be afraid of Jah ever burning fire
Just trust in Jah fire and you'll never get burn
The fire that reigns over heat, air and water
No water can put out Jah fire
Jah fire gonna lift Rasta higher
You don't ha fi dread to be Rasta
(Don't ha fi dread)
This is not a dreadlocks thing
Divine conception of the heart, well
You don't ha fi dread to be Rasta
(Don't ha fi dread)
This is not a dreadlocks thing
Divine conception of the heart
You don't ha fi dread to be Rasta
(Don't ha fi dread)
This is not a dreadlocks thing
Divine conception of the heart
You don't ha fi dread to be RastaEmbed
