Ooh, baby, don't you know I suffer?
Ooh, baby, can't you hear me moan?
You caught me under false pretenses
How long before you let me go?

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bellamy]
Ooh, you set my soul alight
Ooh, you set my soul alight

[Chorus: Matt Bellamy, Chris Wolstenholme, Dom Howard]
Glaciers melting in the dead of night (Ooh)
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive (You set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night (Ooh)
And the superstar's sucked into the (You set my soul)
Into the supermassive

[Verse 2: Matt Bellamy]
I thought I was a fool for no one
But, ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you
You're the queen of the superficial
How long before you tell the truth?

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bellamy]
Ooh, you set my soul alight
Ooh, you set my soul alight

And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive (You set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night (Ooh)
And the superstar's sucked into the (You set my soul)
Into the supermassive
