17 ContributorsA Change Would Do You Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ten years livin' in a paper bag
Feedback, baby, he's a flipped out cat
He's a platinum canary, drinkin' Falstaff beer
Mercedes Ruehl and a rented Lear

[Refrain]
Bottom feeder, insincere
Prophet lo-fi pioneer
Sell the house and go to school
Get a young girlfriend, daddy's jewel

[Chorus]
A change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)

[Verse 2]
God's little gift is on the rag
Poster girl posin' in a fashion mag
Canine, feline, Jekyll and Hyde
You wear your fake fur on the inside

[Refrain]
Queen of South Beach, aging blues
Dinner's at six, wear your cement shoes
I thought you were singin' your heart out to me
Your lips were syncing and now I see
See Sheryl Crow LiveGet tickets as low as $149You might also like[Chorus]
A change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
A change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)

[Verse 3]
Chasin' dragons with plastic swords
Jack off Jimmy, everybody wants more
Scully and angel on the kitchen floor
And I'm callin' Buddy on the Ouija board

[Refrain]
I've been thinkin' 'bout catchin' a train
Leave my phone machine by the radar range
"Hello, it's me, I'm not at home
If you'd like to reach me, leave me alone"
[Bridge]
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
"Hello, it's me, I'm not at home
If you'd like to reach me, leave me alone"

[Chorus]
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
Oh, I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
Oh, I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)

[Outro]
Oh, a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
Oh, I think a change (A change would do you good)1Embed
