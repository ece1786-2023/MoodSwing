Givin' honor to you first
The pastor of the church (Yeah)
My folks and friends listen to these words
See God saved me (Yeah)
From myself when no one else was around
And it was only by His grace (Grace)
His mercy, His favor
'Cause I know I don't deserve
All the love He show (Oh)
And how He let me know (Oh)
He never gonna leave my side

See I got a testimony how He saved my soul (Soul)
When I was just a sinner left in the cold (Cold)
Gave me a second chance, saved me from myself
Came to my rescue when I needed help

He took me from the bottom and put me on the top
He laid His hands on me and now I can't be stopped

[Bridge: Mary Mary]
Somebody told me that we overcome by our testimony
Bet you wouldn't believe how doubt and fear used to paralyze me
But God's hand led me through a test
And He brought out the very best of me
And now I'll never forget to tell the world what You mean to me
