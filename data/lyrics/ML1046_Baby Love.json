(Baby, baby, baby, ooh)\n\n[Chorus]\nNeed ya, need ya (Baby love, baby love)\n(Baby love, ooh, baby love)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBaby love, my baby love\nWhy must we separate, my love? (Baby love, ooh, baby love)\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll of my whole life through (Don't throw our love away)\nI never loved no one but you (Don't throw our love away)\nWhy you do me like you do?\nI get this need (Baby, baby, baby)\n\nOoh, ooh (Need you, need you)\n\n[Chorus]\nNeed to hold you once again, my love (Baby love, baby love)\nFeel your warm embrace, my love (Baby love, ooh, baby love)\n\n[Verse 4]\nDon't throw our love away (Don't throw our love away)\nPlease don't do me this way (Don't throw our love away)\nNot happy like I used to be\nLoneliness has got the best of me (Baby, baby, baby, ooh)\n\n[Chorus]\nMy love, my baby love (Baby love, baby love)\nI need you, oh how I need you (Baby love, ooh, baby love)\nWhy you do me like you do? (Don't throw our love away)\nAfter I've been true to you (Don't throw our love away)\nSo deep in love with you\nBaby, baby, ooh (Baby, baby, baby, ooh)\n[Outro]\n'Til it's hurtin' me, 'til it's hurtin' me (Baby love, baby love)\nOoh, baby love (Baby love, ooh, baby love)\nDon't throw our love away (Don't throw our love away)\nDon't throw our love away (Don't throw our love away)Embed"
