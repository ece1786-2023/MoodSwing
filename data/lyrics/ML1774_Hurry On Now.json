 "lyrics": "1 ContributorHurry On Now LyricsNow my road has turned to tracks\nStones to pebbles, see them roll away\nMy wandering troubles need not break my back\nMmm, sorrow is the price I pay\n\nI sing my sorrows to the morning; I speak them to the night\nYou best believe I'll keep singing until I make my wrongs so right\nDevil said, a pity for your troubles to take your tired old soul\nSo you know you got to go\n\nHurry, to catch the morning\nYou got to hurry on now\nIn the night\nI would heed my sorrow\nAnd it knows, won't be long now\nHurry\n\nNow with blind hands, I crawl this lonely place\nAs my dry tears fall and roll away\nI can't see troubles as they dance behind my back\nOoo, sorrow is my soul to slay\n\nHe stole my sorrows from the morning; he ripped them from the night\nAnd you best believe I'll keep singing to make my wrongs so right\nDevil took a pity of my troubles; he holds my tired old soul\nSo I know I got to go\nYou might also likeHurry, to catch the morning\nI got to hurry on now\nIn the night\nI would heed my sorrow\nNow I know, won't be long now\nHurryEmbed"
