[Chorus]
No fun, my babe
No fun
No fun, my babe
No fun

[Verse 1]
No fun to hang around
Feelin' that same old way
No fun to hang around
Freaked out for another day

[Chorus]
No fun, my babe
No fun
No fun, my babe
No fun

[Verse 2]
No fun to be alone
Walking by myself
No fun to be alone
In love with nobody else

[Bridge]
Well maybe go out, maybe stay home
Maybe call Mom on the telephone
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon

[Verse 3]
No fun to be alone
No fun to be alone
Now hang on, don't you let me go
No fun to be alone
I said to be alone
I said to be alone
No fun

[Outro]
Well I say, well I say c'mon, Ron, I said, I said c'mon, Ron, I said c'mon, Ron and lemme
I said c'mon Ron and lemme hear you tell 'em
Lemme hear you tell 'em
Tell 'em how I, tell 'em how I, tell 'em how I, tell 'em how I, tell ' em how I feel
I say c'mon lemme hear you tell 'em, tell 'em how I feel
Yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
