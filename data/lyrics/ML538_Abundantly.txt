4 ContributorsAbundantly Lyrics[â€‹Verse 1]
It would be like the sky that's never sunny
It would be like the bee that can't make honey
Or maybe like the fallen snow that never melts
Like always hearing of your touch but never felt
It's like the vase that holds no flowers

[Chorus]
Never wanna sleep without You
Never wanna wake without You
I never wanna part with life abundantly
Never take a chance without You
'Cause I'll never do my best without You
I never wanna leave this life abundantly
Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
It would be like the game that has no winner
Like knowing love's behind the door you cannot enter
Like knowing joy's in the morning that never comes
(Kinda like) What life would be if God didn't send His son
It's kinda like a heart with no love flowing through it

[Chorus]
Never wanna sleep without you
Never wanna wake without you
I never wanna part with life abundantly
Never take a chance without you
'Cause I'll never do my best without you (Oh Father)
I never wanna leave this life abundantly
You might also like
[Chorus]
Never wanna sleep without You
Never wanna wake without You
I never wanna part with life abundantly
Never take a chance without You
'Cause I'll never do my best without You
I never wanna leave this life abundantly


[Outro]
Since you came in my life Your source of my abundant livingEmbed
