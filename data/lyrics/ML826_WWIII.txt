10 ContributorsWWIII Lyrics[Intro]
[Sound of bottle of wine being uncorked and poured, then drunk from]
[Banjo]

[Verse 1: Sascha Konietzko]
I declare war on the world
War in outer space
I declare war in a nutshell
War all over the place
I declare war on every government
War against all odds
I declare war on your inner sanctum
On your bloodthirsty gods

[Chorus: Lucia Cifarelli]
World War Three - be all that you can be
World War Three

[Verse 2: Sascha Konietzko]
I declare war on the axis of morons
All-out war on complacent consent
I declare war on the war against drugs
Rape and slaughter of the innocent
War on Big Brother
Warmongers and profiteers
War on your dogma, Dubya
Armageddon's engineers
You might also like[Chorus: Lucia Cifarelli]
World War Three

[Spoken: George W. Bush]
"We're in for a long and difficult war
It will be conducted on many fronts
But as long as it takes
We will prevail"

[Chorus: Lucia Cifarelli]
World War Three - be all that you can be
World War Three

[Verse 3: Sascha Konietzko]
War in a heartbeat
I declare war on so-called civilization
World trade globalization
Organized disinformation
War on ambassadors of pretense
War on MTV and CNN
McDonald's, Walt Disney, and Bethlehem
On Christina, Britney and Eminem
[Spoken: George W. Bush]
"Across the world, governments
Have heard that this message:
You're either with us
Or you're with the terrorists"
"Tyranny, terror, and lawless violence"
[Verse 4: Sascha Konietzko]
I declare war on the world of anti-choice
On violent unilaterality
On the amassment of murderous high-tech toys
And all crimes against humanity
War on the Moral Majority
On corporate dotcom imperialism
On mindlessly bumbling stupidity
And police-state terrorism

[Chorus: Lucia Cifarelli]
World War Three
World War Three - be all that you can be
World War Three - be all that you can be
World War Three

[Spoken: George W. Bush]
"Tyranny, terror, and lawless violence
The future belongs to the free"Embed
