 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsBuilding Bridges Lyrics[Verse 1: Termanology]\nAlpha male, master the alphabet dominant soul, prominent goals Down this road a heartbreak many cars I drove\nOn this quest for love In these Oscar roles\nMy OG's had pockets full of stones\nSelling rocks right in front of my home out of control\nYoung and 15 with a pole, before he turned 16 He was letting it go\nSince the rotary phone I've been globally known\nHad to stop doing press, they was quoting me wrong\nThis a millionaire game but the broke can play even the broke block right twice a day\nEven the baby mama nic\u0435 once in a while cops crooked and th\u0435 judge still foul\nWe broke them down, went from complete wrecks To chicken and sweet chicks Still leaving them speechless I live and breathe hits\n\n[Verse 2:Paul Wall]\nThe name's Wall but I'm known for building bridges\nChasing digits daily Grinding on the road to riches\nCoolest fridges by my fitness, always auspicious\nI'm from where you ruffle the ridges They pop you like Christmas And leave you Covered in lead like a scantron I started off my grind on the Soto and Antoine\nAnd then I moved to Gulf Bank Where shit ain't sweet, it ain't for the weak But no nuts, no Roy Capiche\nI used to flip the Honda Then I moved to a Caprice Hard work and dedication turned me to a beast\nLoyalty and teamwork make the recipe complete\nIt's Wall paper , Term , and Bun B with Statik on the beats\nIndifferent to sleep I'm known to get it in But not known for fitting in\nI'm getting mine then I'm in the wind A wider lens, better check the perspective\nNever retrogressive Lesser progressive, peep the message\n\nYou might also like[Verse 3:Bun B]\nGot the lighter and the weed all I need is the vipe papers\nAnd all my Trill niggas is with me so hi haters\nIf you ain't never done nothing for me, don't ask for favors\nI drop your ass and let someone pick you up off of waivers\nAsk Sam, I leave the ass slippery From all my candy paint drippery But we ain't even dripping G\nI pop the truck and it'll sound like a symphony\nMan hold up Statik I think I just had an epiphany\nFly like the Tiffany Rolex But that's just a low flex\nWait and see where I take the flow next\nHit the ass of club for a smoke sesh\nWe gas nigga, no stress getting paid for it, I'm so blessed\nGot my brother Paul to the right and Term to the left of off me Now what's up sucka motherfuckers trying to F with me ?\nIt's one, two, three of the best That ever did it\nAnd if we shoot the shot, we finna hit it did you get it?Embed"
