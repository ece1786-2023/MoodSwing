5 ContributorsDonâ€™t Let the Green Grass Fool You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, try to remember
When we didn't have no shoes
We stuck together, just me and you
It took a long time to get what we got today
Now you wanna give it all up for another guy

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm tellin' you
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let it change your mind

[Verse 2]
It's gonna be hard for me, baby
To build my life all over
Because baby, you got the love
That I really need, really
'Cause if you leave
Leave me this way, baby
You know what?
I may not live to see a brand new day

[Chorus]
Oh baby, don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let it change your mind
You know why?
It may be greener on the other side, baby
But right in my arms is where you belong
You might also like[Bridge]
Mmm, ooh baby, oh, oh, ah

[Chorus]
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let it change your mind, oh baby
It may be greener on the other side, baby
But ah, right in my arms is where you belong, baby
I got, gotta feel it
Don't let the green grass fool ya, baby
(Don't let it change your mind)
Ah, hey (Greener on the other side)
Don't, don't let it fool ya
Baby, in my arms is where you belong, yeah1Embed
