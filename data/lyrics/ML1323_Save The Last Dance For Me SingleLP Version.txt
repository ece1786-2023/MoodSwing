2 ContributorsTerry Gilliamâ€™s Watchmen LyricsFADE IN:
You can dance
Every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the man
Who held your hand
'Neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, hmm
Oh, I know (oh, I know)
That the music's fine (yes, I know)
Like sparkling wine (oh, I know)
Go and have your fun (yes, I know, oh, I know)
Laugh and sing (yes, I know)
But while we're apart (oh, I know)
Don't give your heart (yes, I know)
To anyone (oh, I know, yes, I know)
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, hmm
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh, so much
You can dance (you can dance)
Go and carry on (you can dance)
'Till the night is gone (you can dance)
And it's time to go (you can dance, you can dance)
If he asks (you can dance)
If you're all alone (you can dance)
Can he take you home (you can dance)
You must tell him, no (you can dance)
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arm's you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arm's you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, hmm
Save the last dance for me, hmm-hmm
Save the last dance for me, hmmm
Save
