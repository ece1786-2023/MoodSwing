You change colours like a tiger in the snow\nYou might also likeAnd you fight like a little Contender\nA broken heart you can never surrender\nA thousand kisses return to sender\n\nI want to love girl but somehow I can't let you in\nDisguised in all your makeup like the seven sins\nYou've got your magic\nBut I'm no believer\n\nAnd you fight like a little Contender\nA broken heart you can never surrender\nA thousand kisses return to sender\nI want to help and i want to protect ya\nBut you got your spies telling lies\nWhere do you go? You change colours like a tiger in the snow1Embed"
