 "lyrics": "4 ContributorsRainbow Stew Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThere's a big brown cloud in the city\nAnd the countryside's a sin\nAnd the price of life is too high to give up\nGot to come down again\nWhen the world wide war is over and done\nAnd the dream of peace comes true\nWe'll all be drinking that free bubble up\nAnd eating that rainbow stew\nWhen they find out how to burn water\nAnd the gasoline car is gone\nWhen an airplane flies without any fuel\nAnd sunlight heats our home\nOne of these days when the air clears up\nAnd the sun come shining through\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe'll all be drinking that free bubble up\nAnd eating that rainbow stew\n\n[Chorus]\nEating rainbow stew with a silver spoon\nUnderneath that sky of blue\nWe'll all be drinking that free bubble up\nAnd eating that rainbow stew\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nYou don't have to get high to be happy\nJust think about what's in store\nWhen people start doing what they oughta to be doing\nThey won't be booing no more\nWhen a president goes through the white house doors\nAnd does what he says he'll do\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus 2x]Embed"
