 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsDoing Nothing LyricsNothing, we're doing nothing\nSitting and wondering why nothing's happening\nEveryone was there\nIn a wooden chair\nDoing nothing\nStill doing nothing\nDrinking, smoking\nNothing's happening\nNo one seems to care\nIn their wooden chair\nDoing nothing\n\nI go walking through the park\nUnderneath a moldy sky\nThinking \"yes I think this place\nWould be such a lonely place to die\nSuch a lonely place to die\n\nNothing we're doing nothing\nLiterally frozen stiff from nothing happening\nSomething has to change\nCause it's no longer feeling strange\nTo do nothing Ad nauseam nothing\nAnd feeling acutely every millisecond pass\nWe can ignore that this is sad\nBecause we know that it all adds up to nothing\nYou might also likeI go walking though the park\nUnderneath the moldy sky\nThinking about all the different ways that would make lonely ways to die\nAll the lonely ways to dieEmbed"
