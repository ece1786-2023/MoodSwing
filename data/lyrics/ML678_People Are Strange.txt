5 ContributorsPeople Are Strange Lyrics[Verse 1]
People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

[Chorus]
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange

[Verse 1 Reprisal]
People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

[Musical Interlude]

[Chorus]
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange, yeah

When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain

No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
