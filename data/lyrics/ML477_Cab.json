 "lyrics": "6 ContributorsCab Lyrics[Verse 1]\nNew York snow this time of year\nThere's nothing more beautiful to me\nExcept for you\nMaking my way uptown and down\nSeeing familiar places and faces\nIn my pile of coffee grounds\n\n[Chorus]\nThe days are better, the nights are still so lonely\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\n\n[Verse 2]\nWatching my breath rise in the sun\nPulling myself in to make warm\nHopelessly feel for my phone and drive away\nThis new rhythm I pursue\nIs just my getting over you\nTelling myself that I need to\n\n[Chorus]\nThe days are better, the nights are still so lonely\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\nSee Train LiveGet tickets as low as $58You might also like[Bridge]\nI'm still looking for a fare\nNo one said that it was fair\nTo be alone\n\n[Chorus]\nThe days are better, the nights are still so lonely\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\nThe days are better, the nights are still so lonely\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the roadEmbed"
