Okay, Roberta, we can do what we wanna do
Touch me right here
Set the night to music
Set the night to music

[Verse 1: Maxi Priest, Roberta Flack, Both]
Look at all the stars tonight
Look at all the moonlight
Look at us, we're all alone
Oh, and it's just like a dream
Like some romantic fantasy
Darling, come and hold me close

[Chorus: Roberta Flack & Maxi Priest]
We could be making love
And with the slightest touch
We could, set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you, to
Set the night to music

[Verse 2: ]
We'll find a rhythm all our own
Melt into it nice and slow
Love ourselves away from here
Your heart beating next to mine
Perfect love in perfect time
Watch the world disappear
You might also like[Chorus: Roberta Flack & Maxi Priest]
This moment is ours to take
And with the love we make
We could set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you, to
Set the night to music

[Bridge: Maxi Priest, Roberta Flack]
Whoa-oh-ho, whoa-oh-ho
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Whoa-oh-ho
Yeah
Yeah, yeah (Oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Chorus: Roberta Flack & Maxi Priest, Roberta Flack, Maxi Priest]
This moment is ours to take (This moment is ours)
And with the love we make (The love that we make)
And with the smile that's ours
We could set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we wanna do
It'll only take me and you
To set the night to music (To music)
[Outro: Roberta Flack & Maxi Priest, Roberta Flack, Maxi Priest]
(Set the night) Set the night to music (To music)
We could set the night to music
(Set the night) (Set the night to music) (To music)
We could set the night to music
(Set the night) (Set the night to music) (To music)
We could set the night to music
(We could be making) (We could be making love) (Love)
We could set the night to music
(We could be making love) (Making love)
We could set the night to music
(With the stars) (We could be making love)
(Making love) (Yes, we could) (With the stars above)
We could set the night to music
(Making love) (Set the night to music) (Stars above)
We could set the night to musicEmbed
