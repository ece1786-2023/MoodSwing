4 ContributorsIâ€™ll Bring The Sun Lyrics[Verse 1]
You took hold of my affections
With your Bible and your sword
Your celebrity connections
I was not used to keeping score
From your fine guilded chalice
I drank all your cheap red wine
It was a good place to be Judas (Judas)
Hiding pearls from the swine

[Chorus]
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun to you when I come
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun to you when I come

[Verse 2]
You won me just as I failed you
Fist full of cake, who could refuse
All of my love got stuck in traffic (Traffic)
Two thousand miles away from you
Bleeding on into the telephone
On a reupholstered bed of nails
I'm a long, long way from home
I hope my jet lagged heart don't fail
You might also like[Chorus]
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun to you when I come
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun to you when I comeEmbed
