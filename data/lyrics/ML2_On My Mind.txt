5 ContributorsAlways On My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
This girl was always on my mind
And although you've got me confused
I swore off running in twos
Eyes meet and magic fills the room

[Verse 2]
You've never seen a girl so fine
Oh, she gets me so high
But when my head is in the clouds
She always brings me down, and I fall hard every time

[Chorus]
But when we're out on the floor
You've got me begging for more
Make it rain, make it pour
Let it rip, let it roar

[Verse 3]
You've never seen a girl so fine (You've never seen a girl so fine)
The kind you've dreamed of forever (The kind you've dreamed of forever)
But there's trouble close behind (But there's trouble close behind)
And I know it's gonna find her

[Verse 4]
This girl was always on my mind (This girl was always on my mind)
She knows and I can't take my pride
I cross my heart, she'll cross the line
I give in every time
Do what it takes just to hold her
You might also like[Chorus]
But when we're out on the floor
You've got me begging for more
Make it rain, make it pour
Let it rip, let it roar
Roar, roar
