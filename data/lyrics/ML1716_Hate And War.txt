18 ContributorsHate & War Lyrics[Intro]
Hate and war
The only things we got today

[Verse 1]
And if I close my eyes
It will not go away
You have to deal with it
It is the currency

[Break]
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

[Verse 2]
The hate of a nation
A million miles from home
And get war from the junkies
Who don't like my form
I'm gonna stay in the city
Even when the house fall down
I don't dream of a holiday
When hate and war come around

[Chorus]
Hate and war
The only thing we got today
Hate and war
The only thing
You might also like[Verse 3]
I have no will to survive
I cheat if I can't win
If someone locks me out
I kick my way back in
And if I get aggression
I give it two time back
Every day it's just the same
With hate and war on my back

[Chorus]
Hate and war (I hate English men)
Hate and war (Just as bad as wops)
Hate and war (I hate all the politeness)
Hate and war (I hate all the cops)
Hate and war (I want to walk down any street)
Hate and war (Dressed like a creep)
Hate and war (I don't care if I get beat up)
Hate and war (By any rotten Greek)2Embed
