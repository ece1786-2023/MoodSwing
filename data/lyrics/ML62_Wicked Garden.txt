19 ContributorsWicked Garden Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can you see like a child?
Can you see what I want?
I wanna run through your wicked garden
Heard that's the place to find you
'Cause I'm alive, so alive now
I know the darkness blinds you

[Verse 2]
Can you see without eyes?
Can you speak without lies?
I wanna drink from your naked fountain
I can drown your sorrows
I'm gonna burn, burn you to life now
Out of the chains that bind you

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you see just like a child?
Can you see just what I want?
Can I bring you back to life?
Are you scared of life?

[Chorus]
Burn (Burn, burn), burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden down
Burn (Burn, burn), burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden to the ground, yeah

Heard that's the place to find you
'Cause I'm alive, so alive now
Out of the dark that blinds you

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you see just like a child?
Can you see just what I want?
Can I bring you back to life?
Are you scared of life?

[Chorus]
Burn (Burn, burn), burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden down
Burn (Burn, burn), burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden to the ground, yeah4Embed
