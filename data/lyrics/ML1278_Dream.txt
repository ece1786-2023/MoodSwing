8 ContributorsDream Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dream when you're feeling blue
Dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

[Verse 2]
So dream when the day is through
Dream and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

[Verse 3]
Dream when the day is through
Dream and they might come true
For things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dreamYou might also likeEmbed
