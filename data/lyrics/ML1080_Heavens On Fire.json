Do you, do you have any idea? I think we should destroy the bogus capitalist process that is destroying youth culture\n\n[Verse 1: Johan Duncanson]\nWhen I look at you, heaven's on fire\nI wish I didn't know you better, but it's pointless\nOne look at you, and heaven's on fire\n\n[Verse 2: Johan Duncanson]\nWhen I look at you, I reach for a piano wire\nFighting to keep it together, but it's pointless\nOne look at you and heaven's on fire, heaven's on fire\n\n[Chorus: Johan Duncanson]\nIt seems like everyone is on your side\nWe're outnumbered by those who take no pride\nIn constantly moving against the tide\nCharlatans just out of reach and out of time\n\n[Verse 3: Johan Duncanson]\nI'm a lot like you, ugly on the inside\nBut while I dive into the gritty, you just stand by\nOne look at you and my heaven's on fire, heaven's on fire\n\n[Chorus: Johan Duncanson]\nIt seems like everyone is on your side\nWe're outnumbered by those who take no pride\nIn constantly moving against the tide\nCharlatans out of reach and out of time\nCharlatans just out of reach and out of timeYou might also like1Embed"
