(Got to know)\nWhere is the love, where is the love you promised me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou said I'd be the only one\nThat you'd be giving your sweet love to\nBut somebody else must be getting your love\n'Cause loving me you just don't do, no, no\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere is the love, where is the love you promised me? (You know I need it, baby)\nWhere is the love, where is the love you promised me?\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm waiting on your love now, baby - where is your love?\nI'm hurting for your love now, baby - where is your love?\nYou might also likeBaby, baby, baby, baby\nBaby, baby, oh, where is the love?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere is the love, where is the love you promised me?
