3 ContributorsNever Enough LyricsHey little girl, why you foolin' around?
Why youu always gotta be puttin' me down?
You don't know what I'm talking about
So hey, little girl, better stop putting out

I've been walking in my sleep
Can you give me what I need?

It's never enough just to hold you
It's never enough just to please you
Ooh baby, it's never enough
You take and you take all you can
Now I need to understand
It's never enough, so baby, bye bye bye bye baby
Bye bye bye bye, baby

Hey little girl, you're a heartbreaker
Why you gotta be such a dictator?
You don't care about how I feel
Why you always gotta be spinning your wheels?

I've been walking in my sleep
Can you give me what I need?

It's never enough just to hold you
It's never enough just to please you
Ooh baby, it's never enough
You take and you take all you can
Now I need to understand
It's never enough, so baby, bye bye bye bye bye
Bye
So long, baby

It's never enough just to please you
Ooh baby, it's never enough
You take and you take all you can
Now I need to understand
It's never enough, so baby, bye bye bye
Ooh baby, bye bye bye
Ooh baby, bye bye bye
