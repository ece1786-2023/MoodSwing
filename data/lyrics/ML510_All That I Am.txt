3 ContributorsAll That I Am Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel a burning, deep inside of me
I feel Your Spirit, it's moving around me
I hear Your voice, You're calling me closer
I know that You're here, You're calling me closer

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will

[Chorus]
Love You with all of my heart
Jesus, I'll love You with all of my mind
Jesus, I'll love You with all of my soul
Jesus, I'll love You with all that I am

[Verse 2]
I know that You hear me when I say my prayers
I know that You're with me even when I'm all alone
When I close my eyes, You're calling me closer
When I pull away, You're pulling me closer

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will

[Chorus]
Love You with all of my heart
Jesus, I'll love You with all of my mind
Jesus, I'll love You with all of my soul
Jesus, I'll love You with all that I am

Was and is and soon will come
Was and is and soon will come
You were, You are, and now You'll come again
You're coming again
Just like you said, You're coming again

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will

[Chorus]
Love You with all of my heart
Jesus, I'll love You with all of my mind
Jesus, I'll love You with all of my soul
Jesus, I'll love You with all that I am

[Outro]
Jesus, I'll love You with all that I am
Jesus, I'll love You with all that I amEmbed
