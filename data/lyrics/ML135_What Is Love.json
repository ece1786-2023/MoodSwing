Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI love you whether or not you love me\nI love you even if you think that I don't\nSometimes, I find you doubt my love for you but I don't mind\nWhy should I mind? Why should I mind?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\n\n[Verse 2]\nCan anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear?\nNever worry never be sad\nThe answer is they cannot love this much nobody can\nThis is why I don't mind you doubting\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be\nThe door always must be left unlocked\nTo love when circumstance may lead someone away from you\nAnd not to spend the time just doubting\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\n\n[Refrain]\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\n\n[Verse 4]\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Verse 5]\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\n[Chorus]\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\n\n[Outro]\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anyway\nWhat is love anyway\nDoes anybody love anybody anywayEmbed"
