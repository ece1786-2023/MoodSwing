[Verse]
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse]
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

[Chorus]
I wanna use you and abuse you
I wanna know what's inside you

[Bridge]
Movin' on (Hold your head up)
Movin' on (Keep your head up)
Movin' on (Hold your head up)
Movin' on (Keep your head up)
Movin' on (Hold your head up)
Movin' on (Keep your head up)
Movin' on!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse]
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

[Outro]
I'm gonna use you and abuse you
I'm gonna know what's inside
Gonna use you and abuse you
I'm gonna know what's inside you
