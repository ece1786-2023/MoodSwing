 "lyrics": "4 ContributorsIn This Home on Ice LyricsBlue you radiant blue\nI don't know how you can stand next to me\nYou you talk like a noose\nAnd only confuse my perplexity\nNow that I'm so sad and not quite right\nI could dance all night\nI could dance all night\n\nShake your rattle-snake skin\nAnd become a part of society\nWait on down the highway\nTo see how far I'll come a-run a-run\nRun running\nAll that we had salvaged from the fire\nWas a waste of time\n(But) what a waste of time\n\nShould I trust all the rust that's on TV\nI guess with some distaste I disagree\nWith quite a fashionable dispassion for\nThe dispossessed under-stressed\nGimme gimme gimme gimme gimme\nAnd I don't care if you don't like it\nOr just don't see\n\nNow that we fattened the cow\nAnd set out to plow unknown enemies\n\"Wow!\" shouts the startled crowd\n\"How now did you see what I did see?\"\nThe ravaged cabbage drifts on dark red skies\nAnd it looks so nice\nGee it looks so nice\nYou might also likeShout just let it on out\nConfusion becomes a philosophy\nDown we're reaching the town where we\nDon't have to stand around and look\nOver our shoulders\nHell I never knew was what we made it\nLet's just take it slow in this home on ice1Embed"
