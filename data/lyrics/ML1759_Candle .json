 "lyrics": "5 ContributorsCandle (Sick and Tired) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI took a ride on a February morning\nJust getting over it and dealing with the mourning\nI started thinking out loud\nI'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMy baby's flying off the edge of the rope\nShe's saying, \"I'm so sorry about that note\"\nThat left me all alone\nBut I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired\n\n[Chorus]\nSomebody turn the lights on\nSomebody tell me what's wrong\nI'd be lying if I told you\nLosing you was something I could handle\nSomebody turn the lights on\nSomebody tell me how long\nAll this darkness will surround you\n'Cause I'm burning for you\nBurning like a candle\n\n[Verse 2]\nSeven days since I've seen your face\nSeven nights I have laid to waste\nI'm burning out now\nI'm sick and tired of being sick and tired\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI know we're hanging at the end of the rope\nWe've flown too high, maybe swung too low\nI heard her screaming out loud (I heard her screaming out loud)\nI heard her screaming out loud (I heard her screaming out)\n\n[Chorus]\nSomebody turn the lights on\nSomebody tell me what's wrong\nI'd be lying if I told you\nLosing you was something I could handle\nSomebody turn the lights on\nSomebody tell me how long\nAll this darkness will surround you\n'Cause I'm burning for you\nBurning like a candle\n\n[Bridge]\nThink, think, think\nAll of the things that you say\nWhat are the things that you mean?\nWhat are the things that you say, say, say to me?\n'Cause you're a tragedy\nA queen for his majesty\nAll this blasphemy\nYour kingdom is crumbling\nYou're a tragedy\nA queen for his majesty\nAll this blasphemy\nYour kingdom is crumbling\n[Chorus]\nSomebody turn the lights on\nSomebody tell me what's wrong\nI'd be lying if I told you\nLosing you was something I could handle\nSomebody turn the lights on\nSomebody tell me how long\nAll this darkness will surround you\n'Cause I'm burning for you\nBurning like a candle\n\n[Outro]\nBurning for you\nBurning like a candle (Ahh-ohh-ohh)\nBurning for you\nBurning like a candleEmbed"
