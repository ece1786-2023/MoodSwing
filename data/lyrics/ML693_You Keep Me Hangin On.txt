15 ContributorsYou Keep Me Hanginâ€™ On Lyrics[Chorus: Mark Stein with Vince Martell, Tim Bogert & Carmine Appice]
Set me free, why don't you babe?
Get out my life, why don't you babe? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You really don't want me
You just keep me hangin' on
You really don't need me
You just keep me hangin' on

[Verse 1: Mark Stein]
Why do you keep comin' around
Playing with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me try to make a new start?
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me

[Chorus: Mark Stein with Vince Martell, Tim Bogert & Carmine Appice]
Set me free, why don't you babe?
Get out my life, why don't you babe? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You really don't want me
You just keep me hangin' on
You really don't need me
You just keep me hangin' on

[Verse 2: Mark Stein]
You said, when we broke up
You just wanna be friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again?
And there ain't nothing I can do about it
(Give it to me)

You know I need love
(Set me free, why don't you babe?)
Talkin' 'bout love
(Get out my life, why don't you babe?) (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You really don't want me
You just keep me hangin' on
You really don't need me
You just keep me hangin' on

[Refrain: Mark Stein, Tim Bogert & Carmine Appice]
Get out my life, why don't you babe? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Get out my life, why don't you babe? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Get out my life, why don't you babe? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Get out my life, why don't you babe? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
