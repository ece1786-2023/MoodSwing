3 ContributorsEndless LyricsShadow of doubt consumes you
The light you barely see
Growing wings of sorrow
Have brought you to the winds of plague
Increscent boundaries fade the way
A barren future all too real
And still I try to seek up and find the flame
And still I try inside
It's endless

A barren future all too real
And still I try
Endless fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Endless tragedy
Endless lunacy

Chalk up the past as a memory
This battering sickness has surely won
Chalk up the past as a memory
This battering sickness has surely won

All I have wasted
Will this erase me
All I have wasted
Will wash away
All I have wasted
Will this erase me
All I have wasted
Will this erase me
Wash Away
Time to clean my wounds

Can I win this battle inside-out

Endless tragedy
Endless lunacy
