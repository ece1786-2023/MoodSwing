(Ah-ah-ah-ah)\nWhen things aren't going your way (Ah-ah-ah-ah)\nBut when love walks out, and the pain walks in\nAnd settles for a stay, ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nLord, help me (If you think you're lonely now)\nI feel like I wanna testify (Wait until tonight, girl)\n(If you think you're lonely now)\nGirl, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)\nIf you think you're lonely, lonely, lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)\nOh, just wait until tonight, girl (Wait until tonight, girl)\n(If you think you're lonely now)\n(Wait until tonight, girl)\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou see, tonight's the night when the needs come out (Ah-ah-ah-ah)\nWhen your needs come out to breathe\nAnd the toils and snares, and there ain't now way you can sleep, oh\n[Chorus]\nIf you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)\nI feel like I wanna testify this evening (Wait until tonight, girl)\nI'm lonely, 'cause I know I gotta leave you, oh, girl (If you think you're lonely now)\nI just can't take no more (Wait until tonight, girl)\nOoh-ooh-ooh (If you think you're lonely now)\nOh, girl, you just wait (Wait until tonight, girl)\n(If you think you're lonely now)\nIf you think you got problems now, baby, you just wait\nWait (Wait until tonight, girl)\n(If you think you're lonely now)\nToo far gone, I'm packing up now (Wait until tonight, girl)\nOoh, ooh-ooh, babe (If you think you're lonely now)\n(Wait until tonight, girl)\nYou say you're a little lonely (If you think you're lonely now)\nBut everybody needs somebody to love\n(Wait until tonight, girl)\n\n[Verse 5]\nIt's good that you know that you got somebody that'll stand by your side (If you think you're lonely now)\nThat'll build you up when you're falling down (Wait until tonight, girl)\nAnd you had that someone, baby (If you think you're lonely now)\n'Cause I've done my time\nAnd it's your turn now (Wait until tonight, girl)\nIf you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)\nWait, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)\n[Outro]\nI'm tired (If you think you're lonely now)\nI'm tired of the same old shuck and jive (You just wait until tonight, girl)\nIt's been too long\nIf you think we could start all over again (If you think you're lonely now)\nIt's been too long (Wait until tonight, girl)\nIf you think we could start just one more time\n(If you think you're lonely now)12Embed"
