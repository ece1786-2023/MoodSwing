1 ContributorRainbows (feat. Katy Wainwright) Lyrics[Verse]
I can't see the clouds for the colours
For the rainbow's covered my view
Again I turn around
And there's another rainbow coming from you
But it won't be long 'til I get home
To see in your eyes and discover
What do they know what you go through
You bring the sun, I brought the water
Brought the rainbows still coming from you
But it won't be long 'til I get home

[Refrain]
Rainbows
Rainbows

[Outro]
But it won't be long
It won't be long
Won't be long
It won't be longYou might also likeEmbed
