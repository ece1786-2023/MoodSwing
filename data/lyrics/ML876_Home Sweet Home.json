 "lyrics": "1 ContributorHome Sweet Home Lyrics[Verse]\nI live out here in the wind and the pouring rain\nSomewhere between 14th Avenue and Main\nIn the summer heat, winter's freezing snow\nYou see I got nowhere else to go\n\n[Chorus]\nGot no home sweet home\nInto this world, some are bound to roam\nAnd it's a long hard road we've known\nOn the way to home sweet home\n\n[Verse]\nPeople pass by, they don't see me here\nAnd if they do, they wish I would disappear\nI guess they know way down deep in their bones\nIt could be them out there looking for a home\n\n[Chorus]\nFor a home sweet home\nInto this world, some are bound to roam\nAnd it's a long hard road we've known\nOn the way to home sweet home\n\n[Verse]\nOh to have a place to lay my head\nA crumb or two for my daily bread\nPerhaps someday a kind soul will come along\nHelp me to find my way back where I belong\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBack to a home sweet home\nInto this world, some are bound to roam\nAnd it's a long hard road we've known\nOn the way to home sweet home\n\n[Outro]\nSweet home\nAll God's children lookin' for a home\nAnd it's a long hard road we've known\nAll the way to home sweet homeEmbed"
