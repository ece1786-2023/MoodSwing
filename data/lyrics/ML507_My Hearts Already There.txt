2 ContributorsMy Heartâ€™s Already There LyricsAll right

I know that Heaven is real
I feel it in my heart
And it's a place I long for
Because it's where You are
So if tomorrow You decide that it's time
Hey, Lord, I'm ready
To leave this world behind

'Cause my heart is already there
In Heaven with You
Ain't it funny what love can do
And my heart is already there
And though I know my place now is here
My heart is already there

I know You're coming back soon, Lord
I can see the signs
Tellin' everyone about You
They're running out of time
I know You're waiting
'Cause You want them to see
How much of Heaven, Lord
Is living in me
You might also likeAnd my heart is already there
In Heaven with You
Ain't it funny what love can do
And my heart is already there
And though I know my place now is here
My heart is already there

It's getting harder to wait
Lord, I live for the day
When I see Your face
I just wanna see Your face

'Cause my heart is already there
In Heaven with You
Ain't it funny what love can do
And my heart is already there
And though I know my place now is here
My heart is already there

My heart is already there
In Heaven with You
Ain't it funny what love can do
And my heart is already there
And though I know my place now is here
My heart is already there
'Cause my heart is already there
In Heaven with You
Ain't it funny what love can do
And my heart is already there
And though I know my place now is here
My heart is already there

(My heart)
In Heaven with You
My heart is already there...Embed
