Cherry Bomb Lyrics[Verse 1]\nLife can be so fair\nLet it go on and on\nI can push for good\nYou got that cherry bomb\n\n[Chorus]\nBlow out that cherry bomb for me\nWe lost it long ago\nYou and me\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow you know your way\nBack from the spirit bar\nBrush your teeth for bed\nBlow out that cherry bomb\n\n[Chorus]\nBlow out that cherry bomb for me\nYou got to know it's on your sleeve\nKnow it's on your sleeve\nKnow it's on your sleeve (Come on, come on)\n\n[Bridge]\nIt was the longest day that I'd ever known\nI watched you start that drive alone\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBlow out that cherry bomb for me\nIt's going to burn right up your sleeve\nBurn right up your sleeve\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo there you go again\nOut in your dressing gown\nGet yourself to bed\nBlow out that cherry bomb\n\n[Outro]\nOh, life could be so fair, let it go on and on\nI could pay to that hand on your cherry bomb\nOh, life could be so fair, let it go on and on\nI could pay to that hand on your cherry bomb2Embed"
