8 ContributorsCreepinâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can hear you sighing
Saying you'll stay beside me
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams?

[Verse 2]
On the beach we're sitting
Hugging, squeezing, kissing
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams?
In my dreams

[Bridge]
When I'm asleep at night, baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night, baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy?

[Verse 3]
Oh, love is so amazing (Oh)
Guess you will be staying
So let it be
That you'll always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night, baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy?

[Verse 3]
Oh, love is so amazing (Oh)
Guess you will be staying
So let it be
That you'll always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

[Outro]
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams4Embed
