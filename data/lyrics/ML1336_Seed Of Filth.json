On my corpse\nFeeding, seeping, pus does flow\nRotten body\n\nThe maggots feed and grow, the maggots feed and grow!\n\nMaggots, maggots! On my corpse\nFeeding, seeping, pus does flow\nRotten body\n\nThe open wounds I cut, now fester and succumb\nTo insect infestation, bacterial infiltration\nOn a microbiotic level, they grow and overtake\nA human piece of waste, an experiment of decay\nGod of the fly, release your seed of filth\nTo grow and conquer, on death, on myself\n\nMaggots, maggots! On my corpse\nFeeding, seeping, pus does flow\nRotten body\nYou might also likeSeed of filth\nSeed of filth\nSeed of filth\nSeed of filthEmbed"
