1 ContributorThis One Is For The Leaders Lyrics[Intro:]
This is my appeal
To all you leaders out there
To stop the war
Cause there is no justifiable reason
It's about time
That you realize
That you're not fulfilling your true purpose

[Chorus:]
This one's for the leaders
Who are fighting war, all over the world
This one's for the leaders
Who are fighting war, all over the world

[Verse 1:]
Think about the youths
Who are dying out (dying out)
Crying out (Crying out)
For love
Victims of the system
You're dividing growth
To break us down
And tear us apart (tear us apart)

[Pre-Chorus:]
What is the future for the human race?
How will the children grow to take our place?
Where is the love that we should all embrace?
I do believe, it's here for you and me
You might also like[Chorus:]
So this one's for the leaders
Who are fighting war, all over the world
This one's for the leaders
Who are fighting war, all over the world

[Ad lib:]
This one
Is for
The leaders who are fighting war
All over the world

[Verse 2:]
Imagine all the money that you spend on arms (spend on arms)
Guns and bombs (Guns and bombs)
To destroy
While people are left hungry
To die from wants
And those who dare survive are unemployed

[Pre-Chorus:]
What is the future of the human race?
How will the children grow to take our place?
Where is the love that we should all embrace?
I do believe, it's here with you and me
[Chorus:]
But this one's for the leaders
Who are fighting war, all over the world
This one's for the leaders
Who are fighting war, all over the world
