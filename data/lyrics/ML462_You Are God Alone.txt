5 ContributorsYou Are God Alone (Not A God) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You are not a God created by human hands
You are not a God dependent on any mortal man
You are not a God in need of anything we can give
By Your plan, that's just the way it is
You are not a God created by human hands
You are not a God dependent on any mortal man
You are not a God in need of anything we can give
By Your plan, that's just the way it is

[Chorus]
And You are God alone
From before time began
You were on Your throne
You are God alone
And right now
In the good times and bad
You are on Your throne
And You are God alone

[Verse 2]
You're the only God whose power none can contend
You're the only God whose name and praise will never end
You're the only God who's worthy of everything we can give
You are God, that's just the way it is
You might also like[Chorus]
You are God alone
From before time began
And You were on Your throne
And You were God alone
And right now
In the good times and bad
You are on Your throne
And You are God alone

[Bridge]
Unchangeable
Unshakable
Unstoppable
That's what You are
Unchangeable
Unshakable
Unstoppable
That's what You are

[Chorus]
You are God alone
From before time began
And You were on Your throne
And You were God alone
Right now
In the good times and bad
You are on Your throne
And You are God alone
[Outro]
Unchangeable
Unshakable
Unstoppable
That's what You areEmbed
