Lyrics[Intro: Freestyle Fellowship]\nAw, yeah\nBoom-boom, boom-boom, mm'hmm\nBoom-boom, boom-boom, aw yeah\nBoom-boom, boom-boom, mm'hmm\nBoom-boom, boom-boom, aw yeah\n\n[Chorus: Myka 9]\nCan you find\nThe level of difficulty in this?\nHaha-haha-ha-hah!\nCan you find\nThe level of difficulty in this?\nHaha-haha-ha-hah!\n\n[Verse 1: Myka 9]\nEvery man for himself, can be difficult, mythical\nTypical, critical, pitiful, beautiful, hypocritical, hypothetical\nAlpha numerical the Darwinian way, obstacle course fittest survival\nUnforgettable, unforgivable\nDiabolical lies within the Bible, Unified Field Theory of Love\nIgnoramus enlightened to his path and purpose\nCreator, preserver, destroyer, curb server\nQuantum mechanics converted from bow ties to Mormon\nAlso a paraplegic, whirling dervish\nPledge of Allegiance backwards\nRocket science nano technology\nAwkward moments caught between a rock and a hard place\nYou're in a sticky situation, zero visibility\nLate night radar emergencies passenger pilot\nTyphoon, hurricane, broken components\nAirstrips, stormy rain, military ship\nLanding a plane to Malaysia, amnesia\nIndonesia with a squeegee\nYou were trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents for a ticket to Fiji\nWith Saturday Night Fever without the Bee Gee's\nAll the doohickeys and thingamabob's of highly sensitive circuitry\nMicro-engineering a blind man behind the wheel steering\nEnergy equaling matter or mass times the speed of light squared\nForeplay with the Catholic nun, makin' a hoe into a housewife\nMaking a crack head drop the pipe\nLooking at Luke's peep show fully dressed\nWith a number of angels dancing on a nuclear warhead\nEveryone on Earth chanting 'Om...'\nTaking bong hits, holding hands, alone\nAt the same time finding a truly righteous queen in a strip club\nPlaying patty cakes with heartless thugs\nGetting the Fellowship to rehearse for a show\nWe do reverse to a flow and do a motherfucking overdub\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Aceyalone]\nWith an elegant battle cry yo' Pocahontas\nYou brought down a shower of meteorites\nPredicting well before Nostradamus discovered before taking Most of us with us\nForever throwing the Earth off of its axis\nThe autistic, artistic, art without the practice\nThe parachute-less, brainless, aimless\nJump out the 25th floor\nOnto a mattress, onto Atlantis\nWill take the Milky Way, in a filthy way\nAnd try to dig a whole to China with a spoon\nHandcuffed to a thousand pounds of C4, while\nDip to the bottom of the sea floor\nThen swim back up to the sea shore\nThen, I'm a sharpshooting contest\nI'll shoot a mango off your head from a mile away\nI shot, ran a marathon barefoot and broken glass without a cut\nTake my place in the stars, see my face on Mars\nHijack NASA for the shuttle with a .38 inch snubnose\nAnd race the cars, take the negative devil gene out of man\nAnd erase the wars with a straight jacket and a crooked face\nAnd a broken stick shifter, a ceremony for audio-body of\nMiracle, spiritual, uplifter\nA Siamese twin Libra, connected amoeba\nBeautiful, wonderful world without miss moon Makeba\nThat's impossible like Ethan Hunt\nBreathing a blunt, well believe what you want\nA serial killer, Gandhi\nLoveable Hitler, A fiddler on a burning roof\nLearning the truth about the one arm, one leg, one peg, one hook\nRock climber to the top, shock rhymer\nGrandfather counter clockwise timer\nOld timer, rap, rhyme designer\nPurely, indubitably, excellent, brilliantly\nIntertwind'er, kinda, off-beat, off-center, odd\nSimple yet confusing, God\nSunshiner with a twist now\nCan you find-a\nThe level of difficulty in this?\nHahahaha-hah!\n[Hook: Myka 9]\nCan you find\nThe level of difficulty in this?\nHaha-haha-ha-hah!\n\n[Verse 3: P.E.A.C.E.]\nTime is running out, only 30 second to go\nKeep marching in that madness\nBut you must challenge the final four\nOr the game, lock it up like a lolo\nRock the cradle like a yo-yo\nBzzzz-fzzzz-Pzzzz\nWhat is robo?\nAnother word for alright, so-so\nAnother word for chocolate, cocoa\nStunt double Wesley Snipes\nIt's faster than your 4-4\nNow that's velvet\nHow did you know?\nCuz I felt it\nNo whack ass albums\nWe'll shelve it\nI be the dope, like Hell Melvin\nEarthquake eerie spots where wackness\nDwells in!\nThey're meeeelting!\nI can smell them!\nStop, Sergio Tacchini, my cherie amour\nTheodore\nAnd Fila, Reebok, silly coq sportif\nWhere's the beef?\nMalt and barley, cereal brands choice\nHot socks with flip-flops\nFreshly fried pork chops\nEat moon soup on a moon rock\nCollard greens boiled with the ham hocks\nSleep in a ham-mock and I flow from the shamrock\nAnd kill ya kill ya with a four lock Glock 9\nSupply mine, spreads the landmines\nCan you find\nThe level of difficulty in this?\n[Verse 4: Self Jupiter]\nYou\u2019d rather jump off the Empire State Building\nWith explosive tipped helmet and\nCopper plated nuclear denture caps, perhaps\nMaybe you\u2019d rather dance through the streets of Iraq\nWearing an American flag, 3 piece suits\nScreaming at the top of your lungs: \u201cShoot!\nFuck Saddam Hussein, there is no God,\" in Arabic\nTruthfully, you got a better chance hitting the lottery 15 times in a row\nNow you tell me the odd\u2019s on that\nYou\u2019d rather get head from a wild bobcat\nYou\u2019d rather slap the chief of police knowing you got 2 strikes\nYou\u2019d rather run up to the White House with a Bullseye T-Shirt on blasting a starter pistol, yellin' revolution!! revolution!!\nYou\u2019d rather sky dive butt naked into a field of meat hooks\nAnd bathe in a flammable solution, solution\nHolding a Philly overdosing on Heron\nYou\u2019d rather try to dope fiend Farrakhan\nYou\u2019d rather walk through a lions den\nWearin' pork chop earrings and cheap top sirloin body oil cologne\nYou\u2019d rather be fully awake while getting operated on\nYou got a better chance of going back to the 1920s\nAs a black transvestite running for president and winning\nYou\u2019d rather go head up with a swinging wrecking ball\nAnd drugged at a 120 miles through a pavement of 10 inch titanium nails\nYou\u2019d rather die for what you don\u2019t believe in\n\n[Hook: Myka 9]\nCan you find\nThe level of difficulty in this?\nHaha-haha-ha-hah!\nCan you find\nThe level of difficulty in this?\nHaha-haha-ha-hah!\n\n[Outro: Freestyle Fellowship]\nMm'hmm\nAh' yeah\nAlright ya'll\nI'll get at you tomorrow then, dog\nAww' haa\nCheck it out\nSalaryEmbed"
