5 ContributorsThe Three Sunrises Lyrics[Verse 1]
Spirit of the rising sun, lift me up
Hold me there and never let me fall

[Verse 2]
Love me till I die, my heart won't wait
Soon I will be loved...

[Chorus]
In this love song, love
Love song, love song

[Verse 3]
Hey, hey, love won't find
Find its own way home

[Chorus]
It's a love song, love
Love, love, love

[Post-Chorus]
Sun shine, sun shine on me
Sun shine, sun shine on me

[Chorus]
In this love song, love
Love song, love song, love
