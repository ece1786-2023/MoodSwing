LyricsDid I remember to tell you I adore you\nAnd I am livin' for you alone?\n\nDid I remember to say I'm lost without you\nAnd just how mad about you I've grown?\n\nYou were in my arms\nAnd that was all I knew\nWe were alone, we two\nWhat did I say to you?\n\nDid I remember to tell you I adore you\nAnd pray forevermore you'll be mine?You might also likeEmbed"
