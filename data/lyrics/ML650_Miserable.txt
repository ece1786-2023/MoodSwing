14 ContributorsMiserable Lyrics[Intro]
You make me come
You make me complete
You make me completely miserable

[Verse 1]
Stuck to a chair, watching this story about me
Everything goes by so fast, making my head spin
Used up all of my friends, but who needs them when you mean everything?

[Chorus]
Well, I love the things that we should fear
And I'm not afraid of being here
With so much the same, it makes me helpless alone

[Verse 2]
Nothing to share, why should I care if you're near me?
I give up all of my plans, but who needs them when you mean everything?

[Chorus]
I love the things that we should fear
And I'm not afraid of being here
With so much the same, it makes me helpless alone

[Bridge]
(Yeah, yeah) You make me come
(Yeah, yeah) You make me complete
(Yeah, yeah) You make me completely miserable

[Chorus]
I love the things that we should fear
And I'm not afraid of being here
With so much the same, it makes me helpless alone

[Outro]
You make me come
You make me complete
You make me completely miserable
(Yeah, yeah) You make me come
(Yeah, yeah) You make me complete
(Yeah, yeah) You make me come
(Yeah, yeah) You make me complete
(Yeah, yeah) You make me completely miserableEmbed
