8 ContributorsInseparable Lyrics[Verse 1]
Inseparable
That's how we'll always be
Inseparable
Just you and me
It's so wonderful
To know you'll always be around me

[Verse 2]
Incredible
What you are to me
Incredible
You bring out the woman in me
With your style of love
Inseparable
Yes, we are

[Bridge]
We're like a flower to a tree
Like words to a melody of love
There's no way we could break up
No words that could make us blow our thing
We are just

[Verse 3]
Inseparable
That's how it is
Inseparable
For the rest of our years
It's so wonderful
To know you'll always be aroundYou might also likeEmbed
