12 ContributorsSick, Sick, Sick Lyrics[Verse 1]
I curse to hell the magistrate
Who granted this unholy fate
But I know, I know I asked for this myself
I'm bound by law to hell
And it's sick, sick, sick, humans and their needs
Living in a fairytale that's tearing at the seams
A dank reject, a devil in a dress
Exactly what you seem

[Pre-Chorus]
Sick, sick, sick
It's sick, sick, sick

[Chorus]
You made a mess of things
My, what a mess you've made
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the way you make me
In your world, it's cold outside
So button up and open wide
I hate the way you make me feel
Sick, sick, sick
Oh
Oh
You might also like[Verse 2]
If memory serves me correct
I gave you all and you gave me less
Your sexcapades deliver checks
But can't afford you self-respect
And it's sick, sick, sick, humans on their knees
Living in a fairytale that's tearing at the seams
A dank reject, a devil in a dress
Exactly what you seem

[Pre-Chorus]
Sick, sick, sick
Itâ€™s sick, sick, sick

[Chorus]
You made a mess of things
My, what a mess you've made
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the way you make me
In your world, it's cold outside
So button up and open wide
I hate the way you make me feel
Sick, sick, sick

[Bridge]
Maybe love is looking for someone to fill old holes
We grow up building lives with holes in all our walls
The walls could fall, but here you were
With spare bricks to save the day
And we pray it's not too late
Spare bricks could be dead weight
[Pre-Chorus]
Sick, sick, sick
It's sick, sick, sick
Sick, sick, sick
It's sick, sick, sick

[Chorus]
You made a mess of things
My, what a mess you've made
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the way you make me
In your world, it's cold outside
So button up and open wide
I hate the way you make me feel
Sick, sick, sickEmbed
