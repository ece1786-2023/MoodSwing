4 ContributorsSettle for My Love Lyrics[Verse 1: Aaries, Musiq Soulchild, Both]
Your love means the world to me
Words could not express the joy you bring
Your love moves me tenderly
To have you by my side means everything, I sing
Your love has the best of me
If I could give you more then that would be, yeah

[Chorus: Aaries]
Settle for my love, settle for my kiss
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss
So dear to me, darling, take my hand
Settle for my kiss
'Cause it's all I can give
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss

[Verse 2: Aaries, with Musiq Soulchild]
Your love, it means the world to me
Ooh-hoo, like the ocean wide your love runs deep
Your love, (Oh baby) it moves me tenderly
Like the birds outside my window sing

[Chorus: Aaries, Musiq Soulchild]
Settle for my love (Oh, settle for), settle for my kiss (Hey, hey, hey)
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss (Yeah)
So dear to me, darling, take my hand
Settle for my kiss
'Cause that's all I can give
Settle for my love (Baby), that you'll never miss

I can't bring you precious stars or paradise
And all these things are really on my mind
All that I can give to you is love so true
From the heart, ooh

[Verse 3: Aaries with Musiq Soulchild]
Your love, it means the world to me (Means the world)
No words, no words, express the joy you bring
Your love (Oh), it has the best of me
If I, if I can only give you everything, baby

[Chorus: Aaries, Musiq Soulchild]
Settle for my love, settle for my kiss (Hey, hey, hey)
Settle for my love (Oh), that you'll never miss
So dear to me, darling, take my hand
Settle for my kiss
'Cause that's all I can give
Settle for my love (Baby, yeah, yeah), that you'll never miss (Hey)
