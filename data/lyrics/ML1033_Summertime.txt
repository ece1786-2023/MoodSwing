7 ContributorsSummertime Lyrics[Verse 1]
Summertime
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich
And your ma is good-lookin'
So hush, little baby
Don't you cry

[Verse 2]
One of these mornings
You're going to rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings
And you'll take the sky
But 'til that morning
There's a-nothing can harm you
With daddy and mammy standing by

[Instrumental Break]

You're going to rise up singing

And you'll take the sky
