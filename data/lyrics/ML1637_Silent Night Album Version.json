dozen studio albums sold over a million records and he may well\nbe your favorite rapper's favorite rapper you'll find him in many likes for greatest nurses of all time so everyone\nplease welcome the man the myth the legend cannabis hey everybody\neverybody love you all right guys so uh yeah i figured let's ask cannabis a\ncouple of questions to get this thing rolling and then we'll get into some song reviews right after that so um\nright away it is i'm curious like just tell us a little bit about like your journey as a hip-hop artist you know\nwhere did you start out and and how did you get to where you are today right so uh you know\nfunny enough um i started out back in the 80s uh beatboxing\nbefore rama right so i used to beat box for well started out breakdancing really that's where it\nstarted my journey with rap music and hip-hop and so you know breaking and popping and\nlocking and all that but that doesn't really go that far after you know what i'm saying your grandmother smashes a\ncouple of your boom boxes you know you start to leave that alone so um uh pretty much got out of the popping\nunlocking and i used to beatbox for one of my homies um that used to uh rhyme\ndown there in uh florida um two live crew was out at the time and there was a group called afro rican and my homeboy\nian used to dj for uh for afro rica now and then and eventually he became my d my dj i went\nto a high school called aboard anderson we used to call the ba for on board anderson but that was back when like the\n18 was out we should just call it b8 because it was like bad news bad attitude type of place but you know we\nmade the best of it a lot of talent came out of florida at that time he had plantation he had dillard high school so\nlong story short with the beatboxing i was beat boxing for my homie used to rhyme\nthen i went from uh beatboxing to starting around myself so\nthat when we would have battles with other other dudes at school or stuff like that we used to flip it on him like\ni was beatboxing he was rhyming and then for somebody's crew who had the same kind of dynamic he would start\nbeatboxing and i would start rhyming and we did it strictly in the beginning to just throw the people who were watching for a\nloop and and and beat the person we were up against or the group we was up against and so uh after doing that\nit really turned things upside down on his head and uh i started to rhyme and then uh i\nwas 13 at the time and then i really got into a series when my mom went up to uh\num one of the ads in the paper that i was looking at to get me in the sonic 16 plus so that i could start sampling and\ndoing beats and so that's how i started and i had to make the beach for my own demo before i met the lost boys which\neventually turned into how i got my recording contract with universal umg\nthat's amazing so you kind of have like you're doing in lots of different things right you started out with the boombap and the i\nmean the the beatboxing did you do any breaking pneumatic just pneumatic\nyeah you said breaking would you say oh group home you said\nwhat's that now did you do any break-in as well when you back in the days oh\nlogan yeah all day man like all day like like um\num from uh you know it's just uh that's like that was something that you\ndo you know kids they bounce off the walls anyway right we were young at that time like we were\nwe were um you talking about like well like you know anywhere from eight\nto like 12 you know what i mean like that was a long time ago boss like so children are always bouncing off the\nwalls and back then there was no internet that we were there was you know there was nothing to keep you glued in one\nplace we were just always bouncing off the walls so breakdancing was something\nwe did just because man it was cool to do and that's what we did in the beginning and then of course like i said\nyou know you started to advance a little bit more and then it came with the beat box and then it came with the\nme going to go get my sonic plus my sampler and that's when i started like sampling and truncating\nbeats what did it call it you truncate quantize your uh lfo wave you cut and\nyou put the little disc in and go you put the os disk\nyeah you know and that's how it started for me you know what i mean so i am familiar with\nwith what the producers do at least at the beat making process um\nonce it gets into the you know like like i've heard stories with a certain you know top of the tier\nproducers they'll run they'll do the make the record and then they'll take it and put it back\nto two inch and then bounce it out on two inch and then put it and then run it back into\ndigital so you know there's techniques that these guys are using now that's just like way over the top\nyou know for sure man i think back on those early days when when you got your first record\ndeal like how do you think the industry has changed now for up-and-coming artists compared to back\nthen so i want to i want to applaud like everybody out there now\nthat's just um that's continuing to do this you know that's even\ntrying to get into it now like trying to break into it now i want to applaud you because\nyou really you're really standing up uh like you're standing up you're facing\nobstacles that we didn't really have at that time when we were coming up and i salute you\nfor it man like it's not nothing now is uh nothing's now nothing now is\nis guaranteed like not even the opportunity anymore like now you know\nyour ambition has to pretty much you got to go in their ambition heavy like you got to have enough ambition to\nspare you've got to have enough determination to be able to start out with a crew of five\npeople and after everybody's quitting or you know something happened they move\noff to the sideline you gotta go it all alone like that's the type of determination\nambition you have to have now and i don't envy this younger generation for it it's very difficult now for them um\ni will say that your company the kind of structure that you guys got going it\nreally does help them it gives them a big boost as to you know their options and what they can do\nbut without without that type of foundation or cornerstone i mean for for me like just for example\nwhen we were coming up you know andre harrell did this uh you know rest in paradise to andre to\nharrell too but so there's a story and i know the story is true but he um\nandre slept like oh he didn't sleep but he spent the night outside one of the offices\nuh it was down there and uh next to times square like not too far\nfrom where the original um uptown records was at because i i i interned at uptown so i i remember\nlike it's running in sabaro's kitchen is above it's like 30 30 38 42nd street like right there in times\nsquare like uh it's right over there in that area and um your quad next to quad quads down the block so it's unique\ndown as those are also famous studios but uptown records was right there on that block like right here in the middle\nof times square and um it's funny because i remember times when the stories were\nthat like dre herrera when he was trying to get his deal for jekyll and hyde he um\nhe wasn't able to uh like get through to the the gentleman that he was trying to meet with you know\nthey weren't interested and so he just like uh like every time he tried to speak to him\nand hand them music they just weren't interested he's like do you have five minutes you're like no not right now so he ended up waiting downstairs\nlike you know when they got off work they saw him there when they came into work in the morning they saw him there like like dre harrell made it impossible\nfor them to get in and out of the building in or out of the building without seeing him till one of the days\nthe gentleman just said to him what what i see here all the time like what can i help you with he's like thank\nyou uh if you got five minutes i'll let you out i'll tell you so he says yeah all right play it man so\nyou know that kind of thing that's how dre andre harrell was able to get his label imprint for you know he\ndid the jekyll and mr hyde thing that's how it started for him but then from there he was able to get his label in\nprint uh basically start to get to uptown have all those artists you know the mary j bliges the uh you know puff\npuff was working as diddy now you know um you know what i mean in the early days jodeci you know father mc heavy d\num so for real lost boys i mean you just name it like so many\ngroups came out of that label and uh you know what i mean like uh\nthat's how andre harrell started that's what i'm trying to say like and nowadays\nyou can't do it that way anymore you can't just sit down in front of somebody's building or you can't you\ncan't you can't you can't strong-arm anybody into giving you a moment to listen to your stuff you\nknow what i mean um and that's sad i don't really envy these folks now because of what they got to go\nthrough it's just endless endless typing on the keyboard you know what i mean you're just sending\nemails everywhere you know what i mean it's it's it's easy for your stuff to get stolen i supposed or reinterpreted\nsomeone take your stuff like it's so easy to get your stuff bootlegged now or or pirated so\ni don't envy him so i gotta applaud you guys for doing it you know what i mean i'm kind of here to learn from you too\nman right on i i think i think all the people i'm seeing in the chat they they appreciate that because yeah it is it is a lot of work i think it is also there's\nso much opportunity now right things are different i think you're kind of being you're definitely being humble too saying like oh i kind of had it sort of\neasy which it was never easy not to mention i think it's dope how you're able to stay on the cutting edge of stuff like\nyou've got you know the nfts you're doing these bundles you know all this kind of stuff so i'm wondering how\nfor for artists who want to like forge their own path and then also stay consistent for decades like you have and\nstay relevant how how have you approached that how have you been able to do that where like you're you're putting out the most material ever it\nfeels like now um you know and you're doing using this new technology and doing all this cool stuff\nwhat was your approach to stay relevant technology is always a always a great\nthing to have on you know you know technology i mean it really\ndoes it when when it's customized for you and built for you\num it can really streamline your your you know your your completion process the\nstreamline and things that you're getting done um your task list but in so insofar as relevancy or\nyou know staying power or whatever you want to call that i gotta be honest with you\nit's up to the fans i call my fans like it's pretty much like a brotherhood and that's who i got to give it up to i\ngot to give it up to them man that's how you you retain your footing man because\nwe all have you know similar to the same if not identical\num uh you know amounts of reach i mean you know we got\nwe got we got we got 10 of these you know sometimes a little bit less i hope not\nanymore we got and we got 10 down there and and you know\nthat can only get you but so far it's it's the fans that are behind you\nthat you know you build a rapport with them where you're giving them something that they can only get from you they\ncan't get it from anyone else and once they identify with that and they know that they can't get it anywhere else now\nyou've got something going on where the synergy and what the technology does is that comes along to help\nyou and them fine-tune a way to stay connected that's that's really that's really what\nthe technology means to me it's a way for me to stay connected to them mind you i don't have as much time as i wish i\nhad in order to just sit down and kick it with them and stuff but um the technology does make it so that\nwe can we can kick it with each other and uh i would say that that's key like\nfor anybody out there wanting to know um i saw reals the reals cassette chase\nyeah it's funny somebody or they just talk about reels or reels and cassette tape yeah so um so uh yeah you know it's about it's\nabout the brotherhood man like your fans your base your uh your demographic\num you always want to have some kind of connection to them to where you know you\ndon't have to ask them what is it that they want in the beginning you just want to do what you're doing and see who\nwho is who gravitates towards it or who who's interested in it and from there you can kind of fine-tune\nwhat's going on and i got to tell you man like my my brotherhood they've been with me\nfor a long time like due to ups and the downs yo and um\nit's you know it's like we grew up together man we've been through a lot of stuff together\nyeah man that's that's really great that you say that because a lot of what gabe and i teach you know we try to teach\nartists and producers how they can have a successful career and a lot of that is based on building a community right like\nhaving that tribe around you and having that relationship because without that you know you don't really have much as\nan artist right you have to you got to treat this as okay so\nlet's let's let's go ahead and let's pay homage to the big labels for one of the things that they get right\nand that's uh when they press the button on you they're getting your stuff on billboards\nit's in the commercials like when the machine presses the button you're everywhere they send your stuff\neverywhere right but that's what they do right okay so\nbut as a but as an artist or someone trying to break into the game because you never hear me really talking\nbad about like umg like my former label you never really because the truth is\nthat if it wasn't for umg taking a chance on me then i wouldn't have gotten anywhere\nyou see where i'm trying to where i'm coming from like of course you have artists that like even let's take cash\nmoney for an example and i'm only bringing them up because i was there i watched how when they came to ung\ncash money was huge where they were at you know in the neighboring south and all that they were huge but they needed\nthat extra off that extra gas when it came to the videos worldwide\ndistribution and marketing like they didn't have that so universal they did a 50 50 and that's but but they already\nhad the the the corvettes the the hummers the jewelry the uh\nthe you know the pt cruisers the bikes the the convoy the police convoy driving\nthem around they already had all that stuff you know the the compound where you got\n20 producers in there producing on on on the tracks at the same time like a compound like a studio compound they had\nall this stuff prior to getting with umg so when they got the umg\nthey were just ready to shoot videos but they had all the toys that you would need for a video so\nonce again a label is going to get you out there to the world known to the world whether you\nhave like all of this money or not they're still going to get you out there but\nyou know if there's any advice or counsel or just kind of like a fail safe\nthat i could give to the people watching is that no matter how huge your label is\nor no matter how big a deal you get and no matter how much you know how great things are going for\nyou once they press the button always remember that if they take it all the way from you tomorrow\nwhat do you have left to work with so you have to treat that situation as if it is 15 minutes you got 15 minutes\nwhat are you gonna do and i i heard that andy warhol that's his that's his uh\nthat's his term he coined that you're 15 minutes so and it really is like 15 minutes man it's not five\nyou know it's not half hour it's not an hour it's more like 15 minutes man which is it's like that you know it's just\nlong enough for you to get used to it and enjoy it but not long enough for you to\nyou know get so comfortable that you know you think that it's never going back to the way it was so you know we\ngot to treat this as like you get in here you know always be cordial and polite\nto these people that are on your team that are with you that are helping you even if they might not be doing it to\nthe best of their ability or they might just be you got to be polite and cordial to them because remember they're just doing a job too and um and you never\nknow where it's going to take you 10 years down the line or 20 year my case 27 years later you know you're still\ngoing to see some of these people out here you you want to have some kind of relationship where they know that\nyou know what this guy's been out here for this many years and uh\nyou know he's he's he's never done this and he's never done this but he's doing this you know what i mean he's you know\nyou can count on him to be this way and if somebody else comes along and says well he's like this they like nah that's\nnot the guy i met the guy i met was was like you know he had his head screwed on straight you know what i mean and so\nthat's what uh that's what i could say to those folks watching man is like always\nalways build your own brand as if if\nif the if the hype and the label gets taken away from you tomorrow that you still have something to stand on\nyou know you still have something to work with yeah no that's great advice and i feel also like if you focus on that first\nbuilding that brand building that community the labels are going to be more interested in the first place anyway right because they nowadays they\njust they're looking for people already have that built-in audience right so if you focus on that but you know even once\nyou once you get on the label like you said later on if for whatever reason it doesn't work out or you move on to your\nown thing you still have that same brand you still have that audience as well so yeah that's the way to do it\noh man well let's let's kind of uh bring it back to right now and and cannabis today and i'm just curious if you can\ntell us a little bit about this new project you brought out today and where people can get a copy of that yeah so um\nlet's see here he said that's why i got it mike club oh he's taking it back okay so uh how many folks we got in here by\nthe way let's take a look at what yeah it looks like almost a hundred\nwow 87 it looks like yeah you can't fit 100 people where i'm at man so that's a big deal but um\nyeah man uh definitely um you know the project right now it's one\nof many um it it pretty much is talking about a certain time an era when we were\nreleasing music like at that level um we were on the road\nthat madie and i and uh born son uh occasionally we bring que solo out there\nwe had him out on the road with us like i mean we were out there getting it popping man so\num those records were done like during that time a little bit before maybe a little bit after and the wreckage kind\nof reflect what was going on at that time like in hip-hop some of my stuff is a little bit\na little bit uh a little bit forward-reaching so so like for example like the record um\nthey had a complete i was recorded in 2014\nand uh and i was talking about a lot of things on there that pretty much had started to transpire\num recently so and that's fay out of complete um so so yeah you know uh this record\nwe're taking a snapshot back as opposed to um\nyou know looking forward like this this almighty era wreck is taking a snapshot back\nmost of the other records i record with 80 and so forth they're always taking a snapshot of the future\nand at the very least like the present you know shout out to all the jurassic fighter j5

the kind of thing that\nlike i'm into i'm really into the collaborations um and uh and i've got like i've got\nlike everywhere i turn i've got a collaboration to either do or complete or or get to and i'm doing that right\nnow but this the site with this little radio station i'm doing that tonight\nand um i'm building and expanding on what's already going on like you guys are gonna see like like as as we're moving in the\nfuture because i know you're heavy in this space hanno i told you uh i got a lot of respect for you um and gabe but\nyou in particular because i watched you build this man i was around like you know 14 years ago 15 years ago and saw\nyour name buzzing back then bro it's a big deal thanks man i appreciate that yeah\ncool man well i'm super excited about that radio show for sure i'll be tuning into that and uh yeah i already already\nlistened to the album you know i know most of the songs already so yeah everybody go check that out it's it's an\nincredible project and uh also shout out to matt for kind of the being there for that process\ntoo like putting together that i guess that time period in your career so you know i wanna drop off i wanna drop a\nbomb on campus right now because he doesn't know you know this this is born in jamaica and anna was well you're born in germany\nor united kingdom germany right germany yeah yeah so so anno and i were doing so much business i had every like record\nlabel we'd ever worked with every artist we'd ever worked with like sign off so he could move to america you know get\nhis work visa and anno's family had never met me and they're like who are you to just uproot\nour son from us and then you know he ended up meeting the love of his life in america and he\nstill lives in the usa and so when i met his family at the wedding they're like we didn't like you at first but you know\nour son is now with his soul mate so like you're good people but like that's how back how far back like anna and i go\nlike we used to talk on like aol instant messenger and stuff like that so it's like all these years later man anno's as\nstrong-willed as anyone i know because man he has to deal with me\nyou did show me some pictures you did show me some pictures y'all was hanging out it was years ago though those\npictures yeah i mean but it still means something that's that's really what what we're talking\nabout like what matt just said there we're talking about relationships we're trying to\nshow the folks that are tuned in and watching this man we're like so one thing we did have then is we\nwe understood a little bit more about long-lasting strong relationships\nthan this this uh confluence of the moore's law\nhas created like it's created a lot of frankenstein stuff where people\nyou know they they're like trolls some of them are trolls or they give way to the troll stuff and they they get\ninvolved in that stuff and it's counterproductive and so what happens is people don't realize that one day you're\nyou're kind of going to be like on the chopping block or close to it and you're going to need people to vouch for you're\ngoing to need people who are real like real people not just you know this this internet stuff you\nknow what i mean so we got to have some kind of real solid connection beyond just\nthe you know the machine and these these these you know the sound waves and just the electric vibe like there has to be\nsome kind of soul vibe still and um i just want to point that out you know\nbecause 10 years down the line you're still going to be here you feel me you know if life lasts if god is good\nyou know what i'm saying life lasts you'll still be here 10 years down the line you want to have build these relationships with folks\nthat you can still count on yeah man life lessons right there i appreciate that but uh listen\nyou know as much as i'd love to like just ask you questions all night and i have lots of them you know most of the guys here they really want to play their\nmusic for you so maybe we can get into playing some tracks and you give us your thoughts\nyeah for sure let me uh let me get some of these lined up we have some of these basically we raffled these off from\npeople who bought um that uh that exclusive tape that's got uh your feature on there i do\nmy preferences i'd rather play the ones from the people who are here so let me know is moochie c or k camp sushi in\nhere let me know we'll make sure to to play your track first otherwise we'll we'll keep going down the line until we\nfind some people that are here um because i'd love for them to be live i know not everybody can make it because\nof work or whatever um so we got kay cam sushi is here he says oh he's here\nyep you saw him okay let me bring him up and in the meantime let's start playing\nhis song all right let me share my screen here\nbam [Music]\n[Music]\nthe next afternoon went straight to keypad zoom grab the next tune this is my world you mel gibson looking for fuel\n[Music]\n[Music] find out it was a duplicate copy damn\nthat sucks to be you poppy i'm not the helles i don't take it personal even though it hurts my feelings they call me\ncaptain double action i practice from nebraska to alaska have fast company extraction a troubled no man with cold\nsteel romance let's dance outdoors near this rusty old ranch the crusty old man\nwill plus scabs all over his hands you weapons again he gonna bust your ass hey yo i used to sell those champ for\ncharlie horse elbow cramps the company folded then got revamped i got the same hardware captain nemo used upgraded with\nsupersonic torpedo tools i got a backup supply line that starts with rhymes the\ncountdown coincided to bounce down as\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nso i gotta keep [Music]\noh\n[Music]\ni know it's a test y'all\nyeah i really like that man i don't i never heard the finished version of that\nwe got uh k camp sushi uh right here what's\n[Music] that you wanted to get busy yo bro yeah you saw how i said as you stood outside\nthe gates of buckingham\ndaddy's second palace knockout and i'm like yo right right when i wrote that\nwow yeah so i never heard the finished product man that's a dope man you got busy on that the wreck is the wreck is\ndope you know thank you what you doing with it you know uh it\nain't got it the hook in it is real small like uh you know if if you're at the record label you know what they're telling you like yo y'all\nneed 16 16 16 what is that [ __ ]\nthat's right all right that's what we talking about man you know i mean we just you know what it is man\nwe still we still young and hot man in spirit yo we we just wanna we just wanna bounce all over the walls let that rhyme\ngo take take the leash off and just let it go big fat\nwhy they so mad at us for doing that man like we just we just trying to stay out of trouble like it keeps us out of\ntrouble it helps burn off that energy man like you know that's a big factor i i mean\nlike i see it like this i'm never gonna stop writing whether i get on or not i don't look for\nthat anymore what i look for is just putting out my heart and letting people know that you know what i'm saying\ntry to let people feel what i'm trying to say you know i'm saying with my words instead of like saying it because it's\nkind of hard i applaud you i applaud you saying that because i always that's what\ni always say you took the words out of my mind i always say\nthat when people the people make their music you're making it for the creator like\nyou're not really making it for you know the charts and the record labels it's not really what you're\nmaking it for you're making it for the creator first and foremost because that's how you're showing that\nyou know if it even makes any sense like if the creator gave you you know seeing the ability to be part by pedal and run\nor walk when that's what you do is you when you're a child you're growing up you know how to crawl and you learn how\nto you know tumble around and eventually you're walking and then you're walking and you're running so\nwhen you get to the point where you can write rhymes or make a beat or play an\ninstrument you're the first person that you're going to impress with that is the\ncreator because the creator gave you that ability you know what i'm saying so so now once that's over with\nyou should be at peace with what you make you just go ahead and make the best you can and you should be at peace with\nit because the creator's satisfied with it the problem is we kind of don't get satisfied as humans\nuntil somebody just sit next to you is like yo you know that [ __ ] is crazy yo let me\nhear that again or until it's playing on the radio it's playing on the tv and everybody's on your jock\nthere's nothing wrong with it there's nothing wrong with it but but i'm i'm making a distinction between the\ntwo it's not that when we make it it's not good enough to be out to be on the radio\nor be on the tv all day that's not what's happening there's just a distinction there where what you're\nmaking if it's like the record we just made that record's dope enough to go all the\nway if a label came behind and i pressed the button on it it could go all the way you should have that before but\nbut since they're not pressing a button on it that's not what the that's not excuse me that's not what's destined for\nthat one then the creator is still impressed by and still happy with it satisfied with it i\nknow what i heard i was satisfied with it and i want you of all people to be satisfied with it\nbrother because that's the whole point you see i'm saying that's the whole point sushi we gotta\nwe gotta and even for the folks out there listening like don't feel bad or feel defeated or feel deflated or\ndon't you know don't get don't get that feeling of um of uh you know lack of self-worth or any\ntype of you know just anything derogatory or negative behind your music not being accepted you know\nby by people somewhere or group here or what have you because like i said we're\nmaking it for the creator first you see what i'm saying right all right that's all cause i feel like\nsometimes people get really they get really caught up in how how it feels and and i need y'all to\nknow for everybody out there listening trust me when i tell you like i've felt\nmore of that pain when it comes to like music and rhyming and rap or what have you\nprobably more than than most people on here i mean i don't know everybody's story but um it's quite possible that i felt\nmore than anybody i i don't got to show many summits and crap\ndifferent summits and then crashed and then and and now it's all about it's all about streamlining it now but but in the\nend in the end what is it you're really looking for you're looking for\nyour work as a whole you know what i'm saying when you look at it from you know when you factor\neverything in and you average the mean you're looking at it for it to be agreeable to the creator you see what\ni'm saying like you you're looking at it for the creators just be like even even if he even if he you know i'm saying\nlike he look at it and you know his stomach gurgle a little bit or he look at it and there's no smile he\ndoesn't crack up like a like a cheese smile or he doesn't but if he just if he just looks and give you the nod or wink\nat you or what have you you know it's agreeable to the creator you know what i'm saying and that's good enough that's\ngood enough brothers that's just it's like yeah it's good enough for us you know\nyeah i was seeing i was seeing that you got your website in the nft website\nyou you getting into that now because i'm into that so right so it's candynft.com\num that's like forward thinking right like like uh i haven't really started\num doing the nft things like full flush as yet because there's a lot more to it\nthan people might think so um i'm pretty much now just looking on ways to\nyou know how to add value to it before i just drop one you don't drop one and then try to add value to it you want to\nadd value before right right i just dropped my my my collection\nokay 27 it's called sushi man in case you you're looking at okay\nmake sure m80 gets the link over there or ano or um gabe gets a link and i'll go over that i'll grab one it ain't\nnothing i'll grab\nwant to do though is you know over the course of time we want to add value to our jones story you feel me like like\nyou just have them it's not valued [Music]\nlike really though in all seriousness we got to add value to our [ __ ] man see\nthe people not gonna tell you that they're gonna these folks that's running this game it's still the wild west and\nsome of the rules are made when they finish making all the rules then they're gonna open the gates and say come on in\nbut you know it's good for us to try to get involved now and see what's going on and try to figure out how to add values\nman you got it right yeah chris rodriguez you know what he talked about yeah they want to add that too but\nwe got to add value to it man we have to because once you know how to add value or you can add value to it then\nyou know by having a little bit of ownership of it now it matters in your world in your life right what what's happening what's\nhappening on other parts of the world is and other things that we do is um\nwe'll have stuff and then someone is devaluing what it is that we're doing it's like rap like rap\nwas devalued for the entire time i was involved with it like raps been devalued like they took\nyou know things that now should be priceless and and you know these things are like you can't find\nthem nowhere you know what i'm trying to say like i mean it was a time when i remember when we were\nlike okay i'm gonna give you an example so i remember the time of motown where there was a there was a restaurant in in\nthe city in new york on the east coast where uh you could um go in in the in\nthe motown restaurant and uh and they had like the motown cafe and\nthey had they had like michael's glove in there they had uh from the eisley brothers they had uh mr\nbiggs cane or something like that or something or another did he have like reality\nthey would have artifact right they would have artifacts and these things like trust me like you didn't even need to call police\nand somebody who's trying to mess around with michael glover and if somebody would have reached in there did something like a glove and somebody would have probably you know saying\nclapped you in there you understand right so\nthat's what i mean by value but now you know look like how valuable is michael's glove now is\nwhat i'm saying you know what i'm saying like somebody would probably tell you it ain't nowhere near as valuable\nyou see where i'm coming from so it's tricky it's tricky how they'll take your value from you so you gotta\ni think that's probably very important for us to do i'm still looking i'm still looking for ways to do it but we gotta\nadd value to our stuff man we have to right right that's good advice i do\nbro\ndope dope i just want to make sure we get you know a little time for a couple other people because i know i know your your time is limited here\num\ni want to make sure we get some of the people that are in here um but we also did you know the format was going to do\na raffle so i'm hoping to play some of the ones that we had already selected so let me know if you guys are in here we're looking for moochie c\num chrome chrome one vp mob star young lee skokie\np dicey uh solo the uh yeah solo the vibe if any of you guys are in here let me know in\nthe chat and and just say hey i'm here this is my name because sometimes your you know your zoom chat name might be\ndifferent um but in the meantime adrian you you sent me one which which one is that that you just sent me\nhearing you say it again oh hey can you hear me yeah\nyeah so i saw somebody post a a youtube link in here i think i'll send it over to you\nokay was that just that was just somebody who who posted one right now that's in the chat yeah i figured some\nof these guys are showing you my [ __ ] [ __ ] okay do you know who it was so i can bring them on\nuh give me a second you're right funny as well\ni'll start playing it we'll figure out who it is uh as as we're playing it okay and as wrap i think is his name yeah and\nthat's right someone just asked how i got outside that's funny i walked outside i took my computer with me\nmagic all right we're about to play this one from ns rap\nand i'm bring them on [Music]\n[Music]\nwhat up\nhey yo i'm the product of watching projects in politics projecting all the products for addicts to get a proper fix\ncause they don't care about the youth the proof is evident that's why i'm so sick triple six can never [ __ ]

was appreciated we got we got and that's wrap on on the\ncall yeah yo yeah i was here i got i got these in man so i'm i'm listening oh yeah no i\ndon't know i could i could hear you vibe into it i could hear you like yeah all right but um\nwhat i really like about that one is it's easy off top to tell that they um\nlike they're fans of of that era that that 90s that 90s with that late 90s rap\never because they got they got nas in there yeah i was bumping a lot of glass mf\ndoom all of that i can tell and i could tell by your flow and i could tell by even like some of\nthe you know what i mean the pockets that you win on the on on the rounds with your syllable placement and all\nthat i could tell that yeah i like to have like you know you know a force behind the lyrics i\nlike word play all of that so get busy you're getting busy yeah get busy when you're right yeah yeah get busy\nthat's what you're doing man um it sounds dope like uh i feel like um\nif you go you know i don't know what what the goal is for you if you're trying to make records to if you're\ntrying to if you're trying to like you know just have your little following and keep it pushing or you trying to\nyou know take your writing ability and go elsewhere with it but if you if you\ni'ma just tell you if you if you wish that hardcore get busy style and you want to make a whole\nrecord like that you want to make an entire catalog like that i think you i think you can make it i\nthink you can make it i think that you can you know you could definitely i know i know personally as a r that's that's my\nlane right there so like i [ __ ] with that all day bro you got a great song and i mean yeah definitely and i got a\nbunch more coming out yeah i have another joint with afro i have a bunch of other stuff coming out\ngood deal appreciate it yeah um yeah like i said um like matt was saying\nthe same sort of thing man like if you because that's the decision that a lot of artists we gotta make right we got to\nmake that decision of which lane you're going to stay in you know the bride\nright yeah everybody doesn't have everybody doesn't have the look you get a sauerkraut potato yeah\nit's rolling dice about six months everybody doesn't have that\nbouncing around you know what i'm trying to say like i'm gonna say this and i'm not saying that they're like there's\nnobody and i'm not saying it for y'all to go run and tell somebody that i said this this is us in this room\num but so i just remember when and it comes to my mind like i remember\nwhen 50 and john got into it right yeah so when 50 and john got into it\ni remember that john m was doing a thing john was making a lot of noise remember when 50 came out\nit was crazy it was crazy yeah but when 50 first came out before\nhe got with aftermath it was like he did that uh you know that how to rob track and then\nthis won a battle the ambulance picking them up and it was like it was crazy because\nit wasn't defeat nobody knew that 50 was going to be the guy that he is today right\ni remember when he came out one of the first things he did was he was like yo john you singing on the records [ __ ] all\nthat you singing on a record [Music] josh stopped singing on the record\nand started he didn't want to sing on the record one and 50 started singing on the record [Laughter]\nand then that's how i don't know if you remember what i'm talking about man yeah of course\n[Laughter] he made him quit for him\nyou're amazing that's like one of the funniest things that happened in hip-hop bro that's crazy man\ndid he did that so that is what i kind of mean about your style your style and your lane you\ngot to kind of be committed to it right yeah 100 yeah i've been doing it for about four\nor five years but it's like i have an idea of where i want to go it's just perfecting the pen game you know\nright right yeah 100 percent yeah so but you got it you got you're\ngonna have a place for you in that pantheon you just keep keep getting busy like that man keep you know i'm saying keep\nkeep uh you know back and forth table tennis table tennis with the creation yeah no i'm i'm\ndefinitely always

you know i'm not sure\nit can only get bigger from here but uh and i'm just you know i'm saying i just pray to the creator man that we\nyou know we don't get it taken from us like that we can we can you know get enough time to enjoy it and make some\nmake some classics but i will tell you that uh collaboration is the way it's the way to\nget to the goal line man it's you can only do it through collaborating i mean when you look at every other industry\nand every other genre of music or entertainment in general you know hollywood went you know when those\ncredits rolled at the end of the film every one of those names in the credit\nand the in the credits you know were were responsible and took you know they pulled their weight\nthey they drew they draw their they had a certain amount of draw weight they told the line to get it across to get it\nacross the line and um that's always something that you know that's what i was saying man build these\nfoundations build them as strong as you can so that you know heading out to the\nfuture you have you you'll have you have crutches out there you know in the event that we're all\nhuman sometimes you make a misstep something happens and it's easier for you to get back in\nstep no straight up brother and actually i've noticed exactly what you said um\nsince dropping collaborations and [ __ ] i've seen the release radar on spotify go way up\num for everybody dropping collabs and stuff my advice is for you to drop on a friday\nspotify picks it right up and get it at least seven days in advance\npitch pitch it to the playlist the editorials and stuff like that and you'll get on the release radar\nand uh that's that's that's solid advice radar advice i can tell i can tell you this\nsince since bis and i started you know working heavy on these records again between\nour drop in december our drop in january our drop in february cannabis is monthly listeners has gone up 65 000\nand his instagram his instagram social media account has gone up 7 200. and uh you know so it's like the more\nthe merrier man that's what we want yeah he's made up very good for all y'all wondering\nwhat those numbers are when he tells you what the fee is man that's what it is see he knows those numbers man he can\nspit him out and he knows where to find him you can't really uh you can't\nyou know you you the maggots couldn't eat match knowledge out of his head you know what i'm trying to say like like he\nmatt got it all up here yo it's all up there man straight up\nand working together collaborating thank god you know we have the ability to work with each other we're all from\nthe same creator you know what it means so let's create will bring you more together through the\nanno domini legion beats pipeline i promise you that oh hell yeah man i'm up for it\nwhat's up all right so maybe we'll wrap it up with a couple of questions what's up brother jesse\nhey headline peace peace headline peace man that was dope the record was dope\ngreat job all right let's see who's got a good question for cannabis to wrap it up something uh that everyone can benefit\nfrom i saw vladimir naval vlad naval that's vlad naval yeah\nyou're a sub captain man you're a sub captain without a dog that's a wicked name man\nthat is my real government name no cap wow um i gotta deal with this webcam real quick\nuh was your pops like a uh you know a spook a sub spook\num see like my whole family was from haiti and all that\nokay so the weird thing is like my mom got my name from\nthis show where they had this little kid and they named him vlad so it was like bloody me\nso that's where i got my name from unfortunately the russian president is making my name look bad but that's not\nwhat we're here to talk about no man hey that name was that name been a powerful name for a long time g\nyou know i'm saying that to have naval behind it that's you know that's like you know these subs the silent fleets\nman it's a it's a it's a crazy government name yeah\nall right but i got three questions that i want to ask real\nquick the first one is related to your\nuh what's a competition you had with eminem back in the day\nwould you have changed anything that you've done during that situation\nlike do you ever look back to a certain track you sit at him and be like dang i maybe should have put this bar in or\nsomething like that well see what happened with with with the\nyou know elvis i call him elvis because he would he's an institution at this\npoint right he's not just a rapper or so anytime when someone's like you know you know they\nthey say his name or they sort of like bring him up if it you know to me\ni look at it like he's an institution they might look at it like he's a rapper but i know that he's an institution at\nthis point so you got to be you you got you you got to be objective about what you're saying you can't just\ndeal with an institution and say and just be subjective and just say whatever you want because you're\ndealing with an institution so so and you know keeping that in mind i'll\nstill be honest and be transparent and what i'll say is like so there were always a lot of\nuh arbitrary parties involved you know if he and i were in the same\nspace if we were in the same room or if we were outdoors in the same kind of cipher circle there was always like\nextra heads standing there or around and i just feel like you know\nwhatever happened and however things developed i feel that a lot of that the\nlion's share of all of that was attributed to these extra folks standing around man\nyou know what i'm saying you know because it was always that it was always that you know what i mean because from\nwhat i understand you know he always loved that kind of hip-hop that style\nand from the beginning and that's what he comes from is that raw spitting you know that that it's all about the\nlyrics and all about you your cadence and you know everything that makes you an mc\nand a great one and and he was always about the same stuff that i was about you know what i'm\nsaying so how things didn't develop to where the fans\ncould you know see us together or whatever like i do take responsibility for things that you\nknow i have said or done maybe to uh like when i poked my chest\nout when something was said and my name came up i had to poke my chest out and defend defend what i was doing but i\nwill say that i was never proactive and i was never the person to like launch a\nfirst attack and stuff like that that was never my style like even up to now how i am\ni'm not the i'm not the proactive offense or i'm never coming at something\nfirst i'm always reacting to things i don't do that anymore but you know\nthat was my baseline was reacting to things and a lot of times when i'd react to it\ni'd react to it and what i was doing was so much more uh inflammatory than\nthan than the the original cause for me reacting to it that people skipped right\nover why is he saying that why is he doing that they would always get right you\nwell i mean look what you just did and nobody ever you know what i mean like looked at the\ncause so um to to you know wrap that in a nice little bow tie for\nyou i really feel that had it not been for certain other arbitrary elements around\nyou know whether you could you could call them people or media or writers or what have you you know there was always\nsomebody telling him or telling me\nthe wrong thing for things to have developed better and that's that's really what it boils down\nto like what do they call it like wrong advice or wrong counsel or things of that nature right\nyou know because you gotta you gotta remember that there are also things involved where for and i'm not i'm not playing this is\nlike it's some type of card that i'm drawing out of a pack but there's truth to it you gotta remember that while\nthere is reverse racism and things like that going on in rap where there was in\nthe in the 90s um you still got to remember that you know there was a there was like a\ntakeover period where it seemed like for every mc hammer you had a vanilla ice or\nfor every um you know for every like uh you know chuck d slash you know um\nuh uh uh uh nice and smooth or or or every uh\nuh groups the group or artifacts or out out outsiders you had uh like an mc\nsearch like a third base you know what i'm saying like for every facet of like rat\nyou would always have like another ethnicity come in there and play ball and i mean if you just look at it\ni'm not like i said i'm not drawing any cards i'm just saying what it like how it developed it always looks like okay\nso you got this person coming out and they've been doing this for a long time then you got this one coming out and\nit's like they rock it straight to you know to untouchable realms where it's like they become institutions you\nknow what i'm saying like somebody else makes it become an institution you know whereas\nyou know what i mean for for those that are you know not so you know i mean not so favored um you\nknow they end up having to like do everything the hard way you know what i'm trying to say and it's just the\ntruth i mean people could say what they want they could be upset at it but i mean we all live it we live that we we\nyou know what i mean like i mean come on man like vanilla ice made so much more than hammer\ni mean you you can't even and i'm not mad at vanilla ice like you know what i'm saying i like vanilla ice you know\nwhat i'm saying like in terms of what he ended up doing after rap like i i looked at vanilla ice as a person and i could\nsee like i could see like how okay he's a cool dude and stuff but you know what hammer was taking care of his family too\nthat's why he went broke he was taking care of people that he didn't know so it's kind of\nthat element was there and and you're asking me that question and i'm giving you an answer i'm giving you more than\njust the answer i'm giving you the background to all of that you know what i'm saying and i saw some of my comments\nbecause hammer was buying everything for people like that's not just it it also it was that when hammer came out\nhe um you know and this i wasn't there in hammers camp but what i'm saying to you is that i saw how\nthe record labels was going crazy about how you know hammer was selling so many records and then and then ice came out\nand then um uh and ice was wearing the same type of pants that hammer was you know\nthem uh the rayon jumps you know what i'm saying yo so so i just remember\nhow hammer was supposed to i think he did is it 5 million the first time or 15\nmillion the first time and then or 5 million and then the next time he was planning for him to do either 15 or 30\nmillion and it's like everybody was behind it but then you know it didn't do that and then they\njust they just started pouring the water on the fire they started to put the fire out instead of\njust give hammer some more lead time give him some more run time because when you look at ice ice got a whole lot of\nthings to keep him to kept him going that that ninja turtle jump all by itself was worth\nthat made him an institution because once he did the ninja turtles jump vanilla ice was out of here man there\nwas no come on man my brother was ordering pizza i was ordering my my little man's pizza and all that with the\nninja turtle junk on it man like so that's really you know i'd say that's\nwhat it is it's it's it's a lot going on with that it ain't just elvis and me\nit could never be that he's an institution there's a lot of things going on you know\nand um but everything's cool everything's cool you know sometimes\nthings develop the way they do and and that's just how it is i mean you you didn't see edison and uh marconi work\ntogether or edison and tesla work together right they they were kind of like at each other and\nthen you know one day you know edison's patents get it and tesla you know passed away\nfeeding pigeons in new york and down in the hotel new yorker we're feeding pigeons in this in in times square where\nwhere all that light that was on outside the electricity he discovered that he discovered the way that that ac power\nworked because from dc the the uh the transformer yeah you got blackballed that's right\nbecause because tesla's and i'm gonna say to shut up about it tesla what tesla wanted to do\nwhich is what none of the other guys wanted to do tesla wanted to\nhe felt like give everybody the energy or access to energy and access to power give it to\neverybody don't just you know you know do it just for military industry like give it to everybody it's free energy\ngive it to everybody and so you know westinghouse and some of the other folks they was looking at him like oh hell nah\nman how we gonna make money off it if we give it to everybody but they didn't understand what tesla was saying was if\nyou give everybody a baseline to start from a rising tide\nraises all boats so today you would have people you would have everybody would have a\ncertain amount of inherent intelligence and ability to do computers\nand like you say you from haiti right so being from haiti you you already know what a third world country situation is\nlike i'm from jamaica so you know that certain amount of the days they might shut the electric off you didn't run running power like so if if tesla if\nthey had to listen to tesla everybody would have had power and free energy right instead they wanted to they\nwanted to industrialize it and make it the way where people got to pay for it so who's the people who had enough money\nto afford had disposable income to pay for it it would be people who you know didn't really live out there\npretty much and and and ethnically that that always looks like something you're\ntalking about numbers on a paper you talk about statistics cool but but there's also it looks like something too\nthere's a visual to all of that and i think people skip over that you know they're so quick to jump on\nyou know what i mean what the media says or what the media writes and i mean i don't know i don't i'm not really sure\nwhy it continues and why it's so redundant but um you know i will i will say that yeah man\nyou know it's just a lot of extra people a lot of other people out here you know\num second thing that i thought of was you being in the game for so long like\nwhat keeps your mind fresh with new ideas what keeps your\nmind always coming up with ways to improve yourself as time goes on\npretty much like you guys man um i get it from the i get all everything\nthat goes on man i get it i get it from y'all man like so the creator\nputs things in motion and then um it speaks to me through y'all like uh you know pretty much like\ni call them like the brotherhood they're not just fans man but i but i do feel inspired\nby the fans um like like that uh a lot of different ideas things i've had that have been\nexpounded on and people are built on like tonight i got a there's a radio station that my homeboy callie ranks and\nthird eye put together and i'm gonna be playing some new stuff on there um uh the almighty record the almighty record\nif we're on long enough i'm going to play pieces of that but this is something that ties into the the almighty and the other you know kaiju\nand one step closer to infinity that ties in but we're on the air from nine nine pm to two a.m and um\nand it's it's all about collaborative stuff and so that's the sort of thing what i'm talking about like i was\ngreatly inspired by some of the musics that that my brotherhood made and to the\npoint where there's some songs that i listened to man and i flat out cry like a little like a little child you know\njust listening to it and the creativity that was involved in that and went into it and that's where the inspiration comes\nfrom that's what keeps me sharp um and i'm i'm blessed for that right i'm\nblessed for getting that from my brotherhood as opposed to from the fans as opposed to\num having like a a person like an anr or someone in\nyour world that's being paid to tell you what to do or what to do next you know you might not really like\nwhat they tell you to do but you got to do it because you're a part of a machine that's a lot bigger than yourself\nyou know on this side of the fence like we all come together in a collaborative effort and and we make good hip-hop man\nwe make hip-hop that if you know if it ain't the biggest it's it's gonna last\nyou know as long as some of the biggest you know and we'll see right we'll see\nwe'll see how long it's around tom will definitely tell that um last\nquestion that i thought of um as\na modern-day hip-hop fan like there will be like fans of today's music\nthat may not be familiar with some of the music in the past\nbecause they may not look back to them i'm not only used to like modern day music\nso how would someone that got a feature from the industry icons\nhow would they be able to market that song to that audience right\nso yeah you just asked like that's the 64 million dollar question um\nyou want me to handle that yeah yeah yeah um vlad there's that's why people like\nme exist um you know not every like baby grand records let me take it back there baby graham records\ni did about eight hundred thousand dollars in record deal advances with them before they ever heard a single\nsecond of music from any record i was pitching whether it was wu chang whether it was uh um jizza bronze nazareth\nwounded culture almighty because all they cared about was how it looked on paper how many famous producers you got\nmy famous features boom here's the money we're gonna market this wu-tang project the same way we're gonna market this dip\nset project same way we're gonna market this jedi manchester project and that worked for them the reality of it is not every artist is\nthe same so people like me exist and when we do our marketing campaigns you know\nthere's there's like a like a like a spreadsheet of like what's up there's 12 things that are important in the music\nmarketing now we're not going to do all 12 every time especially if the budget's not there to do them but we are going to do\nwhat we feel is going to be the strongest to advance you know the ideals of that particular project whether it's an lp or lp or ep a mixtape a single\nwhatever so i'm accessible on the internet uh almighty m80 on almighty\nimmediate gmail almighty m80 on instagram stuff like that um i do\nartists consultations and what i do is get to know the artists craft a plan for\nthem over a course of three six nine months or three six nine 12 months let them run with it so they can see their\nanalytics rise see the subscribers growing see their audience growing and really tap into what's best for them\nwhere as opposed to when you know when cannabis was on the baby grand era when i was on the baby grin era it was like\njust throw it all in the [ __ ] pot and whatever happens happens that's not the case now like you know this this has\nbeen blessed that he has a large cult following that lives on the internet so it's like clearly i don't need to go do\nstreet team marketing you know so it's like to each zone to figure out the strengths and the weaknesses of each and it's kind of like\na trial and er thing i've done enough trial and error between cannabis wu-tang red man snoop corrupt crooked eye bronze\nyou name it to understand what works for each artist and so if you'd like to you know have one of those consultations\nwith me not a problem at all i'll get you on the right path\nlet me let me add to that as well real quick like don't feel like when you put out music that\neverybody that you're trying to make music for everybody right you don't have to please everyone with your output if you know\nyour lane is like old-school boombap hip-hop and that's what you love then it's enough to find the audience that's\nreceptive to that you don't have to appeal to everyone who's listening to the radio i mean for me for example you know i\ni've been making 90s era type beats since basically i started making beats like 17 years ago\nand to this day people still come to me and buy beats because that's my lane and i found my crowd in my audience and they\nlike what i put out so you know i don't feel the need to put out trap music or r b hits just because\nthat's what's playing on the radio as long as you have your audience and you can connect with them and you can build a relationship with them then they're\ngoing to appreciate that from you 100 so that's pretty much 100\nand you got to make enough of it you got to make enough of it right like if you if you if you're just doing it as a\nhobby and it's recreation for you that's cool but if if anyone out there\nyou listen to whoever out there listening and you're so serious about like so serious about it then you know\nwhat you got to make a catalog you got to make a catalog and and you know unfortunately\nbecause that's why i say i don't envy you like y'all and you know you're coming up and this i don't envy you you\nlike what your task is ahead of you is because like you have to make a catalog it might take\nyou know that that time is increasing as as as you know as we get more connected with\nwith this technology but you might have you might be sitting on a catalog\nand it'll take you know it's going to take way longer than it would when we were we were in the 90s and you you know\nsomebody had a hundred albums you know back in in the 90s you're like who where take me to him that's all we\nwanted to hear back then is like who got you oh you got catalog like that because most of us couldn't even get into there\nwas no equipment like that you had to go into a studio and pay for the the 12-hour blockout sessions you know what\ni'm saying but now you can have your own equipment in your home you know what i mean nice portable stuff you can\ncollaborate like this through sending emails emailing waves and files and sound session sessions so so you know\nnow if you're serious make sure you have that catalog because while you might not blow up today or\ntomorrow or next year in three years it might that opportunity might present\nitself and you've got the catalog now so now and then you own it you still own your catalog so now\nyou know you talk to somebody like 80 like m80 and he's gonna he's gonna go ahead and give you the tools you need\nand the resources for you to continue owning it or if you want to slice off a piece of it to the highest bidder you\ncan do that too but those options are available for you but you ain't going to have none of that if you don't have\ncatalog so yeah so keep keep recording\nyeah great advice here yo i think i think we'll do one more question and then we'll wrap it up\nso if somebody has a really good one uh what's hearing i saw uh jamal jamal was on here i think\nhe had something to ask jamal you there yeah i'm here can you hear me yeah yeah\nyeah um see like you know back in the day it was only regular hip hop boom bap\nand gangsta rap but now it's like so many different subgenres of hip-hop\ni was just wondering like how does one determine his primary subgenre sub-genre hip-hop\nwow um so this is jamal dobson right yeah\ncrazy man you got you got two of the names like two of my favorite people uh\nit's mike dobson and then you got uh you got jamal you know if they're in new york man jamal used to run around with\nme man help me do things man but that's crazy though but anyway um to answer your question like you know\nwhat brother that's above my pay grade maybe maybe 80 could take that or and or\nhow does it like with so many different sub genres in hip hop how does one determine his primary subgenre\nyeah i could i could take a quick stab at it i mean matt i'm curious what you have to say but i think basically it comes down to testing and seeing what\nfeels good to you but then also what people respond to and then the other thing too is also sometimes um like like\nwe're making our right we're trying to express ourselves but if if we're looking at this as a business we also have to cater to our customers and that\ndoesn't mean you have to make any one genre or the most popular genre or anything but you do have to make music\nfor somebody so if you think about who is that person who am i trying to speak to and then just make sure it speaks to\nthem to me that's a lot more important than figuring out what's the exact name of this of this scenario i mean like\nmost of the music i make is like real interpersonal music like i talk about my personal life my experiences what i go\nthrough but like when i when i go to run my run my promo campaigns and stuff\ni like all these subgenres pop up like even when i go to distribute it all these subjects\nsometimes i don't know which one to pick and it by the way it doesn't matter what you pick because the only people that\nsee that for instance like cd baby does that the only people that see that are people that actually log on to cd baby\nno one sees that if you're on itunes no one sees it if you're on spotify or title or apple it's just something they\ndo for their own kind of like classification system on their website but uh i mean yeah ultimately it's like\nyou fall into the genre that makes you feel good and best defines you so like my i have an older brother and\nhe when i was young and when i was rapping always wanted me to be like like little dicky like i could have been a little dicky before lil dicky but i\ndidn't want to rap like that i liked being funny like around my friends but i didn't want to like be funny on the mic\ni want to like spit bars so that's the difference like who knows maybe i'd still be like you know rapping\nfull-time if i would have gone the little dicky comedic route with it because you know that that seems like\nthat's more acceptable now but in the era of cannabis and wu-chang and and big pun it's like i didn't want\nto be like my bars are hilarious i wanted to like be respected by the people i looked up\nto so that didn't fit at the time but now hip-hop is so expansive you can\nliterally get in where you fit in with no qualm like this is who i am this is the genre i fall into and it's cool to\nhave interpersonal music because people will identify with the same [ __ ] you're putting out there for the world it's\ntrue [Music] yeah and if all if if all else fails\njust make up your own genre do your own thing like literally like grape diggers and\nflatliners and [ __ ] made up horror core rap there was no horror core like there was no like emo rap until\nartists x y and z came around like you can if you want you can make your own [ __ ] like there was no little dicky\nbefore little dicky like you can make it up as you go\nright so when you when you um when you start your pr campaign um\nlike say for somebody who has no articles no reviews or anything yet how would you determine your uh\ntarget audience i i would base a campaign with a regional\npr rep to start getting you local press regional press stuff like that then\nbuild up so it's like it's like you're not going for the gusto off top you're not getting source and double xl and\nvibe and you know all hip-hop and stuff but you can start getting some some local like they'll plug you to the\nlocals they'll plug you to the regionals and then after you know say a month goes by and those stories kind of like\ndisseminate into the market and your product is out then you know you have follow-up so it's like then as you're\ngetting a different pr rep that's going to get you the national exposure when they type here here's what they don't want to see no one wants to type your\nname in on google and the first one that comes up is your facebook or your instagram like that should be like on\nthe 10th page so the first nine pages should be filled with press and it's like you got to\nbuild to that so it's like don't waste your money because it's not like like a pr rep can\ndo their job but it's not up to them if hip hop dx picks up your [ __ ] or double xl picks up your [ __ ] they're going to\npick up the music that they think is going to bring the most traffic therefore the traffic equals ad dollars and ad dollars you know boom it keeps\nthe [ __ ] motor moving so it's like don't look like man like i gave my money to this pr rep and i\ndidn't get [ __ ] for results it's literally because you aim for the stars when you know you weren't ready yet you\nknow it wasn't ready so i always build a system where it's like this is what we can do on a local and regional basis\nthis is what we can do from regional national and and take it that way because otherwise\nif you're soliciting to like one of these big you know assets and they don't see anything like any\nanything to back it up then they're just going to pass on it because it's not going to bring traffic to their site\nso a lot of times i used to have artists like like upcoming artists like the icons pack is a perfect example of like\nwhat i used to do for these independent artists you know my artist jason bain dating back to like\n09 got him one of the best record deals like ever and uh his first appearance isn't like hip-hop\nyx and double xl and the source where jason bane drops new single featuring\nfred the god song jason bain drops new single produced by street runner so they were picking up the story based off the\nassociated name that's big name you know big [ __ ] if it got enough traffic on that merit then he could go and get\npress like the next time you want to drop a solo song on his own accord but he couldn't have got to that level had\nit not been for the building blocks so the icons package kind of gives you the pr building blocks to really get out\nthere in your in your region like yes there's gonna be other people that have the same verse as you but guess what\nlike it's not like you're competing with the guy who lives across the street right you make your song to appeal for your\nregion and this dude's gonna make his to appeal to his and that's what it is like i broke her licenses all year round in a\nbig a big portion of the of the um of the consumer base is either rappers\nmaking mixtapes or rappers trying to build their first albums or people in the edm world because they don't care\nabout if they've heard that little wayne verse from 10 years ago they want to see the name of wayne and their vibe into it\nin the club and it's like they're not paying attention to the [ __ ] lyrics anyway just makes for good music so that's\nthat's my short-term answer but again i hope that a lot of you tuned in you know for some consultations and i can make\nsome good things happen for you but even if not anno and gabe make good [ __ ] happen for you guys every day and i\napplaud them yeah yeah i appreciate that man so yeah let's wrap it up guys i just\nwant to say a huge shout out to m80 thank you shout
