3 ContributorsEasy, Easy, Got to Take It Easy Lyrics[Verse 1]
As I lay here next to you
Holding you in my arms, baby
I get a thought here in my mind
It says "Take your time"

[Chorus]
I don't wanna move too fast
(I don't wanna move too fast)
I don't wanna move too fast
(I don't wanna move too fast)
So if I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
If I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
We gotta take our time and do it

(Easy, easy, got to take it easy)
(Easy, easy, got to take it easy)

[Verse 2]
Ooh, this feeling is good
But I can't get too excited, no
'Cause if I move too fast
See if it just wanna last, no, no

[Chorus]
I don't wanna move too fast
(I don't wanna move too fast)
I don't wanna move too fast
(I don't wanna move too fast)
So if I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
If I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
We gotta take our time and do it
You might also like(Easy, easy, got to take it easy) do it easy
(Easy, easy, got to take it easy)

Ooh, baby, let's go, let's go

[Chorus]
So if I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
If I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
We gotta take our time and do it

(Easy, easy, got to take it easy)
(Easy, easy, got to take it easy)
(Easy, easy, got to take it easy)
(Easy, easy, got to take it easy)

[Outro]
God knows this feelin' is good, it's good
And I want this good thing to last, it's good
Ever, ever
Easy, easy
Easy, easy
Easy, easy
Easy, easyEmbed
