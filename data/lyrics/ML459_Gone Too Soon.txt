30 ContributorsGone Too Soon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

[Verse 2]
Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

[Chorus]
Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

[Verse 3]
Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

[Verse 4]
Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon
You might also like[Verse 5]
Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

[Chorus]
Born to amuse
To inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

[Verse 6]
Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

[Outro]
Gone too soon5Embed
