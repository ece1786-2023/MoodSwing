Team LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also likeBack to the mirror now\nThere's nobody left to defend\nIts here that my loyalty ends\n\n[Chorus]\nGot a history and it's catching up\nCrossed the nation like a rolling blackout\nGot the mystery but it's not enough\nAin't a prison but you'll never get out\n\nRealise\nStaying over is your only prize\nNow I know\nSome forgive\nBut I don't\n\n[Outro]\nNo delay\nGet out today\nGet out if only I could\nLetting go\nI could say no\nBut I won'tEmbed"
