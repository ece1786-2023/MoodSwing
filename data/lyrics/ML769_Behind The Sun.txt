13 ContributorsBehind the Sun Lyrics[Verse 1]
One day while bathing in the sea
My talking dolphin spoke to me
He spoke to me in symphony
From freedom's peace beneath the sea

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He looked to me eyes full of love
Said, "Yes, we live behind the sun"

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Behind the sun

[Chorus 2]
The sun goes up and the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun, my heart continues to pound

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun

[Verse 2]
Now while I shower in the rain
I watch my dolphin swim away
The one who listens to the surf
Can feel the pulse beat of the earth

And like my dolphin swims so free
The sun does swim into the sea

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Behind the sun (hahahaha)
Behind the sun

[Verse 3]
An island flying through the sky
One day your son might ask you why
And if your son should be a girl
She too might ask you of this world

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The sun shines sweet upon your beach
And yes my dolphin loves to teach

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Behind the sun
[Chorus 2]
The sun goes up and the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun, my heart continues to pound

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun

[Outro]
