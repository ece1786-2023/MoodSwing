18 ContributorsNext Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, the look on the cake, it ain't
It ain't always the taste
My ex-girl she had such
Such a beautiful face
I wanted love
But not for myself
But for the girl so she could
So she could love herself

[Chorus]
Oh, my next girl
Will be nothing like my ex-girl
I made mistakes back then
I'll never do it again
Oh, my next girl
She'll be nothing like my ex-girl
It was a painful dance
Now I got a second chance, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, her beautiful face and her
And her wicked way
And I am paying for her beautiful face
Every day
All that work over
Over so much time, if I
If I think too hard
I might lose my mind

Oh, my next girl, yeah
Will be nothing like my ex-girl
I made mistakes back then
I never do it again
With my next girl
She'll be nothing like my ex-girl
That was a painful dance
And I, I got a second chance, yeah

[Outro]
Oh-oh
Oh, my next girl, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
My next girl5Embed
