Well look who's coming through the door
I think we've met somewhere before
Hello love, hello love
Where in the world have you been so long
I've missed you so since you've been gone
Hello love, hello love

[Verse 2]
Make yourself feel right at home
I hope you plan on staying long
Come in love, come in love
I must say I was sure surprised
You're the last thing I expected by
Hello love, hello love

[Chorus]
I've heard it said time and again
You often go back where you've been
I really didn't believe it was true
But I left the door unlocked for you

[Verse 3]
I'll try to please you in every way
Assure you of a pleasant stay
This time love, this time love
I've been so blue since you've been gone
Now you're back with me and nothing's wrong
Hello love, hello love
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I've heard it said time and again
You often go back where you've been
I really didn't believe it was true
But I left the door unlocked for you

[Verse 4]
It's wonderful now you're back with me
And things are like they used to be
Remember love, remember love
You're back with me now and my world's complete
So don't mind me if I repeat
Hello love, hello love, hello love, hello loveEmbed
