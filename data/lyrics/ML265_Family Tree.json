 "lyrics": "1 ContributorFamily Tree LyricsI'm not happy with this conversation*\nToo little righteous indignation\nI'm not sure if I'm mad or mean\nThe tears I cry could mean anything\n\nJust cause you're kin I let it slide\nInsults and judgments I've been blind\nAnd it hard for you to deal out digs\nWith a calloused heart your words are quick\n\nI'm sick and tired of throwing stones\nCause all that leaves is broken bones\nAnd I won't shed no blood for you\nAww the cuts too deep the bruise too blue\n\nI've wasted time and been hand fed\nYou can't take back the things you said\nToo much time has gone and passed\nShattered lives and broken glass\n\nThe pain is felt behind my eyes\nBut you won't see me through my disguise\nCan't change fate cause this is done\nAww too late to start the race is run\n\nNow's the time to face the facts\nThis train done slid right off the tracks\nRegret is sad revenge is sweet\nI'm walking on my own two feet\nYou might also likeYou could have come along but you broke my heart\nNow's the time for me to start\nLiving my life without you\nBeing a rock in my shoe\n\nCan't write the book cause this one's wrote\nTime's a friend and love's a foe\nThe future's mine indeed it's grand\nYou ain't a part of my plan\n\nWhen you lay down and think of me\nThere won't be much serenity\nJust know that the aching in your brain\nIs the sound of your soul's grief and pain\n\nThis apple's done fall off the Family Tree\nThis apple's done fall off the Family TreeEmbed"
