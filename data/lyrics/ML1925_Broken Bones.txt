2 ContributorsBroken Bones Lyrics[Verse 1]
Walking a fine line between wrong and right, and I know
There is a part of me that I try to hide
But I can't win and I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Runnin' away from the world outside

[Chorus]
Now I am calling, hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody to believe in something
And I won't fear this when I am falling
We all need somebody that can mend
These broken bones

[Verse 2]
Caught in the confines of the simple life and I am
Holding my head high in the rising tide
And I can't win, and I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Runnin' away from the world outside

[Chorus]
Now I am calling, hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody to believe in something
And I won't fear this when I am falling
We all need somebody that can mend
These broken bones, bones, yeah

I'm not coming home now, I know
I'm so far away, so far from home
I'm not coming home now, I know
I'm so far away, I'm so far away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't win and I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight

[Chorus]
Now I am calling, hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody to believe in something
And I won't fear this when I am falling
We all need somebody that can mend
These broken bones

[Outro]
And I can't win and I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside

And I can't win and I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outsideEmbed
