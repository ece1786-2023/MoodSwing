15 ContributorsLondon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Smoke lingers 'round your fingers
Train - Heave on to Euston

[Refrain]
Do you think you've made the right decision this time?

[Verse 2]
You've left your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see the jealousy in the eyes of the ones who had to stay behind?

[Refrain]
And do you think you've made the right decision this time?

[Verse 3]
You've left your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows that "When he goes, he really goes"

[Refrain]
And do you think you've made the right decision this time?You might also like3Embed
