3 ContributorsTrouble Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
So many days since you went away
I often think of you night and day
But I know that someday, someday, darling
I won't be trouble no more

[Verse 2]
Trouble, trouble, and misery
Is about to get the best of me
But I know that someday, oh someday, darling
I won't be trouble no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I told you my story, I sang my song
About you leaving, baby, you know that's wrong
But oh, someday, someday, darling
I won't be trouble no moreYou might also likeEmbed
