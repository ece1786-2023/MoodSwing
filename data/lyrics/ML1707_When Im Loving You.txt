3 ContributorsWhen Iâ€™m Loving You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You take a fine tooth comb
And you get to the heart of me
You're like my favorite song
And I follow the melody
On a clear, blue night
Up on  mountain side
Like mornin' rain
Under the northern sky

[Chorus]
A dream come true
When I'm lovin' you, hey, yeah-yeah-yeah, you
Hey, girl, yeah

[Verse 2]
Your love is Santa Claus
And it's Christmas time
It's like a fantasy
I'm on a carpet ride
Over the rainbow
Up to the water's edge
It's like a fairytale
Livin' inside my head

[Chorus]
And I feel so fine
When I'm lovin' you
Hey girl, baby

Forever faithful, girl
Like childhood friends
So soft and warm
I hope it never ends
And I'm thankful, girl
For all the joy you bring
Like we be makin' love
Up on an angel's wings

[Chorus]
It's like paradise
When I'm lovin' you, ooh-woo-woo-woo
Hey girl, yeah

[Interlude]
Hey girl
Baby

[Outro]
It's like paradise
When I'm lovin' you
Baby, baby, yeah
When I'm lovin' you
Hey, hey, girl
When I'm lovin' you, I'm lovin', I'm
I'm lovin' you, babe
I'm just lovin' you, baby
When I'm lovin' you, girl
I'm lovin', I'm lovin', just lovin'
When I'm
I'm lovin' you, girlEmbed
