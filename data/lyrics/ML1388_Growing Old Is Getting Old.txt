8 ContributorsGrowing Old Is Getting Old Lyrics[Verse 1]
So we all are growing old
And it's getting old
Pressure on our hollow bones
And the varicose
Suddenly, we decompose
But we're not alone
So we all are growing old

[Chorus]
Maybe we're sealed in silence
And maybe we feel a guidance
Maybe your own devices
Will keep you afraid and cold, but I

[Verse 2]
Memorized your smile lines
When lips divide
Kept alive your childlike
Reaction time
We're allowed to expire
With ourselves in mind
So we all are growing old

[Chorus]
Put out the fear of silence
And put out the need for guidance
And put out your own devices
And don't be afraid of the cold

We sing, we sing, we sing
We fight, we fight, we fight
Then we cry, we cry, we cry
Then we slide, we slide, we slide into the light

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Do we sing, we fight, we cry?
We slide, we slide, we slide into the light

[Chorus]
Maybe we're sealed in silence
Maybe we feel a guidance
Maybe your own devices
Will keep you afraid and cold, well
Put out the fear of silence
Put out the need for guidance
Put out your own devices
Don't be afraid of the cold
Afraid of the cold, afraid over time
You've got nowhere to go but here2Embed
