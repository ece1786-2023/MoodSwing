Who knows where the cold wind blows
I ask my friends, but nobody knows
Who am I to believe in love
Oh, love ain't no stranger

[Verse]
I looked around and what did I see
Broken-hearted people staring at me
All searching 'cause they still believe
Oh, love ain't no stranger

[Verse]
I was alone and I needed love
So much I sacrificed all I was dreaming of
I heard no warning, but a heart can tell
I'd feel the emptiness of love I know so well

[Chorus]
Love ain't no stranger
I ain't no stranger
Love ain't no stranger
I ain't no stranger to love, no, no, no

[Verse]
Can't hold the passion of a soul in need
I look for mercy when my heart begins to bleed
I know good lovin', I'm a friend of pain
But, when I read between the lines it's all the same
You might also like[Chorus]
Love ain't no stranger
I ain't no stranger
Love ain't no stranger
I ain't no stranger to love

[Verse]
So who knows where the cold wind blows
I ask my friends, but, nobody knows
Who am I to believe in love
Lord, have mercy
Love ain't no stranger

[Hook]
I ain't no stranger

[Verse]
I was alone and I needed love
So much I sacrificed all I was dreaming of
Can't hold the passion of a soul in need
I look for mercy when my heart begins to bleed

[Chorus]
Love ain't no stranger
I ain't no stranger
Love ain't no stranger
I ain't no stranger to love
[Outro]
Love ain't no stranger
Love ain't no stranger
I ain't no stranger1Embed
