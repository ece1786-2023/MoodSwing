 "lyrics": "2 ContributorsAll My Hate and My Hexes Are for You LyricsMy burning hate at sight\nIt first seems so insane like a vagrant in the rain\nBut your face at night\nDrills a tick-tock in my brain, digs canals across my face\n\nWhen I hold the fury of the world\nAll the eyes of little girls will be flames that dance and swirl\nAnd they'll melt you to your bones, char your eyes turn you to stone\nAnd when the future finds you there and they stack you in the air\nI'll be there\n\nNo love to spend on you\nI can piss away my cash, my time I can't get back\nAnd your face at night\nDances tick-tock on my brain, digs it's digits in my face\n\nWhen I hold the fury of the world\nAll the eyes of little girls will be flames that dance and swirl\nAnd they'll melt you to your bones, char your eyes turn you to stone\nAnd when the future finds you there and they stack you in the air\nI'll be there to burn down that skyscraper too\nAll my hate and my hexes are for you\nAll my hate and my hexes are for you\nAll my hate and my hexes are for you\nAll my hate and my hexes are for you\nAll my hate and my hexes are for you\nAll my hate and my hexes are for you\nAll my hate and my hexes are for youYou might also likeEmbed"
