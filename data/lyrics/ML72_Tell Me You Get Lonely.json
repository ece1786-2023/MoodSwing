 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsTell Me You Get Lonely Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI bet you're kicking yourself for letting me walk away\nMaking yourself a list of the things you wish you didn't say\nSitting by the phone hoping it's gonna ring\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me you get lonely when it's cold outside\nTell me that you're only barely getting by\nI need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name\nIt ain't the same without me, girl\nTell me you get lonely\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes you're up all night crying over me\nYou've gotta take off of work to catch up on your sleep\nBut that just don't work, now does it, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nSo tell me you get lonely when it's cold outside\nTell me that you're only barely getting by\nI need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name\nIt ain't the same without me, girl\nTell me you get lonely\n\n[Bridge]\nTell me you get lonely, and I'll come back\nAll you've gotta do is call me, my bag's been packed\nI'm dying of pride, but I want you to know\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThat I get lonely when it's cold outside\nBaby, I'm only barely getting by\nAnd it still hurts every time that I hear your name\nIt ain't the same without you, girl\nBaby, I get lonely\nYeah, I get lonely\nTell me you get lonely, too\nTell me you get lonelyEmbed"
