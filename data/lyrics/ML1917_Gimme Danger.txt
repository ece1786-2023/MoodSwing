15 ContributorsGimme Danger Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I feel with you at ease
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I feel your disease

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's nothing in my dreams
Just some ugly memories
Kiss me like the ocean breeze

[Verse 2]
Now, if you will be my lover
I will shiver and sing
But if you can be my master
I will do anything

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's nothing left alive
But a pair of glassy eyes
Raise my feelings one more time

[Chorus]
Find a little stranger
Find a little stranger
Say you're gonna feel my hand
Say, gotta gimme danger, wild little stranger
Honey, gonna feel my hand
Swear, you gonna feel my hand
Swear, you gonna feel my hand
You might also like[Outro]

Little stranger
Gimme danger
Gimme danger
Gotta feel me
Gotta feel me
