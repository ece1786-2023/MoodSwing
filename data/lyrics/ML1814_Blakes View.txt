"Death is just a door," Blake said it first
It's just another room we enter, it's a threshold that hurts
Birth is just a chorus, death is just a verse
In the great song of spring that the mockingbirds sing

[Chorus]
We come and we go, a-weeping and a-wailing
Our heads in the hands of the nurse
Well, put your head on my shoulder, baby, tell me where it hurts
You say you lost your one and only, could it get any worse?
I say death is just a door, you'll be reunited on the other side

[Verse 2]
Birth is just a chorus, death is just a verse
In the great song of spring that the mockingbirds sing

[Chorus]
We come and we go, a-weeping and a-wailing
Our heads in the hands of the nurse
Well, put your head on my shoulder, baby, tell me where it hurts
You say you lost your one and only, could it possibly get any worse?
Death is just a door, you'll be reunited on the other side

[Outro]
Yeah, death is just a door
You'll be reunited on the other side, alright
Yeah, death is just a door
You'll be reunited by and byYou might also likeEmbed
