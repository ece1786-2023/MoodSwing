Oh! Oh! Oh!\n\n[Chorus]\nI need you now\nWhoa! Oh! Oh!\nMore than words can say\nI need you now\nWhoa! Oh! Oh!\nI've got to find a way\nI need you now\nBefore I lose my mind\nI need you now\nMore than words can say\nI need you now\nWhoa! Oh! Oh!\nOh! I gotta hear you say\nI need you now\nBefore I lose my mind\nI need you now\n\n[Outro]\nI need you now1Embed"
