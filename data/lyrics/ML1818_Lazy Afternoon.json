 "lyrics": "5 ContributorsLazy Afternoon LyricsIt's a lazy afternoon\nAnd the beetle bugs are zooming\nAnd the tulip trees are blooming\nAnd there's not another human in view but us two\n\nIt's a lazy afternoon\nAnd the farmer leaves his reaping\nIn the meadow cows are sleeping\nAnd the speckled trouts stop leaping upstream as we dream\n\nA far pink cloud hangs over a hill\nUnfolding like a rose\nIf you hold my hand and sit real still\nYou can hear the grass as it grows\n\nIt's a hazy afternoon\nAnd I know a place that's quiet except for daisies running riot\nAnd there's no one passing by it to see\nCome spend this lazy afternoon with me\nCome spend this lazy afternoon with me\nLazy afternoon\n\nIt's a hazy afternoon\nAnd I know a place that's quiet except for daisies running riot\nAnd there's no one passing by it to see\nCome spend this lazy afternoon with me, with me\n(Lazy afternoon, a lazy afternoon)\nThere's nothing like lazy, lazy afternoon\n(Lazy afternoon, a lazy afternoon)\nHold my hand, let's go deep into a lazy\n(Lazy afternoon, a lazy afternoon)\nYou and me\n(Lazy afternoon)You might also likeEmbed"
