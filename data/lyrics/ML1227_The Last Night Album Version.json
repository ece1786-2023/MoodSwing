 "lyrics": "2 ContributorsFetish for the Finite Lyrics[Album version:] (Oh!!)\n\n[Verse 1]\n[Laurence Beveridge:]\nI have never had a way, with words\nBut someone out in the night, is waiting for me\n(Oh) But can you blame them?\nYou all see the blood, on my hands\nI'm coming out, swear I'm unarmed\nCan't you see that there's fireworks, in the sky?\nOn a night like tonight, could you watch a man die?\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a fetish for the finite, that grips my soul\nLike a Lucifer love, makes me whole\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Oh) At the window, skinless hands, tap glass\nI'm handed a spade and I dig through the carpet my grave\nWill you do it for me, or must I myself?\nIs what I did really so bad?\nCan't you see that I'm learning real fast?\nI swear by my heart, that this sin is the last\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a fetish for the finite, that grips my soul\nLike a Lucifer love, makes me whole, woah, woah-oh!\nYou might also like[Instrumental]\n\n[Bridge]\nNo justice here, no softness, dear\nYou can take those things I left there, but don't take my memories\nNo (no), I can't stand another night, knowing you're not mine\n(Oh) You can take those things I left there, but don't take my memories\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a fetish for the finite, that grips my soul\nLike a Lucifer love makes me whole\nUnder emerald skylines we fight, for our love\nLike militia of the lost, we war, war, war..\n[Kier Kemp:] Like militia of the lost\n[All:] We war!Embed"
