8 ContributorsGo Insane Lyrics[Verse 1]
Two kinds of people in this world
Winners, losers
I lost my power in this world
'Cause I did not use it

[Chorus]
So I go insane
Like I always do
And I call your name
She's a lot like you

[Verse 2]
Two kinds of trouble in this world
Living, dying
I lost my power in this world
And the rumors are flying

[Chorus]
So I go insane
Like I always do
And I call your name
She's a lot like you

[Instrumental Break]
You might also like[Chorus]
So I go insane
Like I always do
And I call your name
She's a lot like you
Yes, I go insane
Like I always do
And I call your name
She's a lot like you
She's a lot like you
She's a lot like youEmbed
