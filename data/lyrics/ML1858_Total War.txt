Lambs to the slaughter, certain death awaits
Trapped on a field littered with bones
Nations of falling lying below

Now you march forward to die
Ten million bodies piled high
Mechanized engines of war spitting lead
Horrors of battle fill you with dread
Bombs are falling, death is calling
Fire raining from the sky
Blown to bits by a hail of lead
Fall without a reason why

Call upon gods of death
Fight! Awaken all your rage
Launch the attack, no turning back
Charge! Your destiny awaits
The order is given, over the top
Scream, for you it is too late

We'll give you what you've been waiting for
Total war

Bombs are falling, death is calling
Fire raining from the sky
Blown to bits by a hail of lead
Fall without a reason why

Fight! Awaken all your rage
Launch the attack, no turning back
Charge! Your destiny awaits
The order is given, over the top
Scream, for you it is too late

We'll give you what you've been waiting for
Total war

Not ready to die, though your time will come tonight
Total war
Battle continues, will you ever win the fight
Total war
All the life that was in you, now is gone
Total war
The battle's over but the war rages on
Total warEmbed
