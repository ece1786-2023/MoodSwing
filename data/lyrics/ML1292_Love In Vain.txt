1 ContributorLove in Vain LyricsIf you really love him, tell me that you love him again
If you really love him, tell me that you love him again

And you won't mind when
I suggest you go
Then you said to keep calm
And we won't tell a soul
And you really must do this
So we will, never be alone
I won't treat you wrong
And at least in love
The hearts won't be apart for too long
So don't say it again

If you really love him then tell me that you love him again, and go
I can see your love changing hands before, too long
If you really love him then tell me that you love him again, and go

If you really love him, tell me that you love him again
If you really love him, tell me that you love him again

I let go of your hand as you suggest I go
And with that I was gone
And after all that was said
Was it meaningless
When you danced with me
To "Walkin' in the Sand"?
And I'd like you to know
That my love is love that you can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
You might also likeIf you really love him then tell me that you love him again and go
I can see your love changing hands before, too long
If you really love him then tell me that you love him again and go
I can see your love changing hands before, too longEmbed
