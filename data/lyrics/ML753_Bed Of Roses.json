 "lyrics": "16 ContributorsBed of Rose\u2019s Lyrics[Verse 1]\nShe was called a scarlet woman by the people\nWho would go to church but left me in the streets\nWith no parents of my own, I never had a home\nAnd an eighteen-year-old boy has got to eat\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe found me outside one Sunday morning\nBegging money from a man I didn't know\nShe took me in and wiped away my childhood\nA woman of the streets this lady Rose\n\n[Chorus]\nThis bed of Rose's that I lay on\nWhere I was taught to be a man\nThis bed of Rose's where I'm living\nIs the only kind of life I'll understand\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe was a handsome woman just thirty-five\nWho was spoken to in town by very few\nShe managed a late evening business\nLike most of the town wished they could do\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd I learned all the things that a man should know\nFrom a woman not approved of, I suppose\nBut she died knowing that I really loved her\nOf life's bramble bush I picked a rose\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThis bed of Rose's that I lay on\nWhere I was taught to be a man\nThis bed of Rose's where I'm living\nIs the only kind of life I'll understand\n\n[Outro]\nThis bed of Rose's that I lay on\nWhere I was taught to be a man\nThis bed of Rose's where I'm living\nIs the only kind of life I'll understand, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh4Embed"
