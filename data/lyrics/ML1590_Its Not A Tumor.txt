1 ContributorItâ€™s Not a Tumor LyricsYou did not understand
Let me rephrase the question
Your comments are killing me
Why won't you stop talking
Now from all this noise
I have a headache
I have a headache

You think it might be
Might be a tumor
It's not a tumor
It's not a tumor
You think it might be
Might be a tumor
It's not a tumor
It's not a tumor

Stop talking
Stop talking

It does not matter
Who my daddy is
I was asking you the question
So just listen, listen, listen
Listen to me!
You might also likeIt's not a tumor
It's not a tumor
It's not a tumor
It's not a tumor
It's not a tumor
It's not a tumor

Yeow!

My daddy is not a fireman
He is probably big
But he's not a wrestler, yeow
He is definitely not a basketball coach
But all these questions give me a headache

Now

It's not a tumor
It's not a tumorEmbed
