Sometimes Im afraid of what I might not get to say
Sometimes I believe that everything is what it seems
And were just to scared to try
Do we have what it takes when hope and clarity melt away
To rise above our mistakes
If we dont know any other way
And were just too scared to try
When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets
It feels that way sometimes
So lets take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isnt over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
Sometimes there can be so much more beyond what we see
Sometimes Im amazed how we see the world in different ways
And were just too scared to try
When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets
It feels that way sometimes
So lets take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isnt over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
Sometimes Im afraid of what I might not get to say
And were just too scared to try
Yeah were just too scared to try
When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets
It feels that way sometimes
So lets take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isnt over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
So lets take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isnt over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
