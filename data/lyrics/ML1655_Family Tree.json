 "lyrics": "1 ContributorFamily Tree LyricsFamily car we barely fit\nChristmas time had come again\nBundled up to fight the freeze\nPicking out the family tree\n\nWe decorate with clumsy hands\nAnd hope that Santa\nComes again\nAnd the morning wake to see\nGifts beneath the family tree\n\nAnd I don't know where I'm going\nBut I do know who I'll be\n'Cause memories and names like these all hang\nOn us the family tree\n\nWe're older now\nWe all have changed\nBut we all have at the same old things\nWe'll spend the night with memories\nGathered round the family tree\n\nAnd I don't where I'm going\nBut I do know who I'll be\n'Cause memories and names like these all hang\nOn us\nYou might also likeWe're so much more than blood\nWe're more than names\nWe're bound by bonds that only God sustains\n\nBut, this time of year\nWe gather here\nAnd I always know I'm home\n\nThere are voices now\nWhere silence was\nThe subtle signs of growing up\nWhere one is born another leaves\nBranches on the family treeEmbed"
