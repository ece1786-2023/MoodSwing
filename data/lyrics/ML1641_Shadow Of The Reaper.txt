1 ContributorShadow of the Reaper LyricsThe shadow of the reaper, the shadow of the dead
Entombs the lifeless
The darkest black is cast
The shadow of the reaper, will you take its hand
The shadow of the reaper, the grave now calls to you

In the cemetery
You have been left unburied
The vultures pick at your eyes
In the cemetery
You have been left unburied
The vultures pick at your eyes

The cold grasp, a bloody hand
The skeleton, it cracks
And it's twitching
Inside of your body
The brain retreats
The heart beats no longer
In denial
Life no longer there
To comfort
To invigorate
To betray you
The rotten now await you
You might also likeMeet the Devil's keeper
In the shadow of the reaper
The rotten now await you
To invade you

The shadow of the reaper, the shadow of the dead
Entombs the lifeless
The darkest black is cast
The shadow of the reaper, will you take its hand
The shadow of the reaper, the grave now calls to you

In the cemetery
You have been left unburied
The vultures pick at your eyes
In the cemetery
You have been left unburied
The vultures pick at your eyesEmbed
