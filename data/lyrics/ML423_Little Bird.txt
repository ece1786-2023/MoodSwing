2 ContributorsLittle Bird Lyrics[Chorus]
Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna sing like you
The whole day through
Oh little bird why can't I be like you?
Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna be that brave
And never save
My loving for some other rainy day

[Verse 1]
'Cause you fly away
When it's cold and you can't find another way
But you will sing and you will love until you find a place
That you can stay
You can stay
Sing your little heart out 'til your dying day
Oh little bird

[Verse 2]
And I'll fly away
When it's cold and I can't find another way
But I will sing and I will love until I find a place
That I can stay
I can stay
And be as bold as you until my dying day
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna sing like you
The whole day through
Oh little bird why can't I be like you?
Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna be that brave
And never save
My loving for some other rainy day

[Outro]
Oh little bird
Oh little bird now I will ne'er be blue
Because of you
Oh little bird now I can sing love trueEmbed
