5 ContributorsWhat Love Has Joined Together Lyrics[Verse 1]
It would be easier to take the wet from water
Or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us
And stop us from holding hands

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I love you (I love you)
I love you from the bottom of my heart

[Chorus]
And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart

[Verse 2]
It would be easier to take the cold from the snow
Or the heat from fire
Than for anyone to take my love from you
'Cause you're my heart's desire

[Pre-Chorus]
And I love you (I love you)
I love you from the bottom of my heart

[Chorus]
And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart
You might also like[Bridge]
Even if they separate us
A thousand miles apart
We will still be together
In each other's hearts

[Verse 3]
It would be easier to change all the seasons
Of the year
Than for anyone to change the way I feel about you
I love you dear

[Pre-Chorus]
Really love you (I love you)
I love you from the bottom of my heart

[Chorus]
And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart

What love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apartEmbed
