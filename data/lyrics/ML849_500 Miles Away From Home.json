 "lyrics": "6 Contributors500 Miles Away From Home Lyrics[Intro]\nI'm five hundred miles away from home\n\n[Verse 1]\nTeardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote\nShe said we miss you son we love you come on home\nWell I didn't have to pack I had it all right on my back\nNow I'm five hundred miles away from home\n\n[Chorus]\nAway from home, away from home\nCold and tired and all alone\nYes I'm five hundred miles away from home\n\n[Verse 2; Lines 1-3: Spoken, Line 4: Sung]\nI know this is the same road I took the day I left home but it sure looks different now\nWell I guess I look different too 'cause time changes everything\nI wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way\nOh I wonder what they'll say when I get home\n\n[Verse 3]\nCan't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait\nAnd I'm still five hundred miles away from home\nIf my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight\nBut I'm still five hundred miles away from home\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAway from home, away from home\nCold and tired and all alone\nYes I'm still five hundred miles away from home\nLord I'm still five hundred miles away from homeEmbed"
