7 ContributorsBlue Jean Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
I done ran into my baby
And finally found my old blue jean
I done ran into my baby
And finally found my old blue jean
Well, I could tell that they was mine
From the oil and the gasoline

[Instrumental Break 1:13-2:22]

[Verse 2]
If I ever get back my blue jean
Lord, how happy could one man be
If I ever get back my blue jean
Lord, how happy could one man be
Because if I get back those blue jeans
You know my baby
Be bringing them home to me
