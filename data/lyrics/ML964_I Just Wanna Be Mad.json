 "lyrics": "5 ContributorsI Just Wanna Be Mad LyricsLast night we went to bed not talking\n'Cause we'd already said too much\nI faced the wall, you faced the window\nBound and determined not to touch\n\nWe've been married seven years now\nSome days it feels like 21\nI'm still mad at you this morning\nCoffee's ready if you want some\nI've been up since five\nThinking about me and you\nAnd I've got to tell you\nThe conclusion I've come to\n\nI'll never leave, I'll never stray\nMy love for you will never change\nBut I ain't ready to make up or get around to that\nI think I'm right, I think you're wrong\nI'll probably give in before long\nPlease don't make me smile\nI just want to be mad for a while\n\nFor now, you might as well forget it\nDon't run your fingers through my hair\nYeah that's right, I'm being stubborn\nNo, I don't want to go back upstairs\nI'm going to leave for work\nWithout a goodbye kiss\nBut as I'm driving off\nJust remember this\nYou might also likeI'll never leave, I'll never stray\nMy love for you will never change\nBut I ain't ready to make up or get around to that\nI think I'm right, I think you're wrong\nI'll probably give in before long\nPlease don't make me smile\nI just want to be mad for a while\n\nI'll never leave, I'll never stray\nMy love for you will never change\nBut I ain't ready to make up or get around to that\nI think I'm right, I think you're wrong\nI'll probably give in before long\nPlease don't make me smile\nI just want to be mad for a while\nI just want to be mad for a while\nI just want to be mad for a while\nI just want to be mad for a while1Embed"
