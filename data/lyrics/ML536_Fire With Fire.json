Just a simple meeting of the minds\n\n[Chorus]\nSinging we'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire\nThrough desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire\nWe'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire\nYour desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire\n\nUnderneath your stars\nThere's a million lies burning brightly just like fireflies\n\nIt's cold and heaven surround you from every direction\nCause there's someone behind every hand that you've made a connection\nAnd now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away\nI had a dream we were holding on and tomorrow has become today, become today\nYou might also likeAnd now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away\nWe've got a reason to keep holding on, tomorrow has become today\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we'll fight with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire\nThrough desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire\nWe'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire\nYour desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desireEmbed"
