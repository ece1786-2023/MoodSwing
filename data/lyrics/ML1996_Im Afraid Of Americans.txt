Johnny's in America,
Lo-Teks at the wheel
No one needs anyone
They don't even just pretend
Johnny's in America

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

Johnny's in America

[Verse 2]
Johnny wants a brain
Johnny wants to suck on a Coke
Johnny wants a woman
Johnny wants to think of a joke
Johnny's in America

Johnny combs his hair and Johnny wants pussy and cars
Johnny's in America
