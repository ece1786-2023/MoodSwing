24 ContributorsCivilian Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am nothing without pretend
I know my thoughts
Can't live with them
I am nothing without a man
I know my faults
But I can't hide them

[Verse 2]
I still keep my baby teeth
In a bedside table with my jewelry
You still sleep in the bed with me
My jewelry and my baby teeth

[Verse 3]
I don't need another friend
When most of them I can barely keep up with
I'm perfectly able to hold my own hand
But I still can't kiss my own neck

[Verse 4]
I wanted to give you everything
But I still stand in awe of superficial things
I wanted to love you like my mother's mother's mothers did
