4 ContributorsLove Never Fails Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love is not proud
Love does not boast
Love after all
Matters the most
Love does not run
Love does not hide
Love does not keep
Locked inside
Love is the river that flows through

[Refrain]
And love never fails you

[Verse 2]
Love will sustain
Love will provide
Love will not cease
At the end of time
Love will protect
Love always hopes
Love still believes
When you don't
Love is the arms that are holding you

[Refrain]
Love never fails you
You might also like[Bridge]
When my heart won't make a sound
When I can't turn back around
When the sky is falling down
Nothing is greater than this
Greater than this

[Verse 3]
'Cause love is right here
Love is alive
Love is the way
The truth, the life
Love is the river than flows through
Love is the arms that are holding you
And love is the place you will fly to

[Refrain]
Love never fails you1Embed
