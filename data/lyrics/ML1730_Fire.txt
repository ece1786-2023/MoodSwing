18 ContributorsParty Like A Rockstar (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Shop Boyz & Lil Wayne]
[Intro: Anthony Kiedis]
Well, alright-a
Now, dig this

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
You don't care for me, I don't care 'bout that
You got a new fool, huh? I like it like that, ha-ha
I have only one a-burnin' desire
Oh, ah, could I make love with your fire?

[Chorus: Hillel Slovak, Flea, & Anthony Kiedis]
Let me stand next to your fire (Fire, fire, fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Burnin', smoky fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Freaky, static fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Aw, yeah)

[Break: Anthony Kiedis]
Wah-huh
Now, just listen to this
Stop actin' so crazy

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Say your mom ain't home, it ain't my concern
Just don't play with me, and you won't get burned
I have only one burnin' desire
I'm gonna be doin' it in your fire

[Chorus: Hillel Slovak, Flea, & Anthony Kiedis]
Let me stand next to your fire (Fire, funky fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh, to your fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Freaky, static fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Aw, yeah)

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Oh, move over, Rover
And let Mr. Huckleberry take over
You know he's bad, you know he drowns
You know who he gives it to, ya, ha-ha, yeah

[Guitar Solo: Hillel Slovak]

[Break: Anthony Kiedis]
That's right
Now, do this

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
You try to give your money, you better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one a-burnin' desire
Oh, can I make love over your fire?

[Chorus: Hillel Slovak, Flea, & Anthony Kiedis]
Let me stand next to your fire (Fire, funky fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Freaky, static fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh, to your fire)
Let me stand next to your fire

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
You better slide yo ass over, girl
'Cause I'm comin' through once, and I'm comin' through once real hard
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ha, ha-ow, ha-yah
