3 ContributorsYouâ€™re Not The Kind LyricsYou're not the kind of a boy for a girl like me
I'm just a song and a dance, you're a symphony!
I thought that you never would doubt me
But I'm tellin' you you'd be much better off without me!

You're just the kind of a boy who would always play fair
I'm just the kind of a girl who would never be square
It's so hard to let you go
But it's only because I know
That you're not the kind of a boy for a girl like me

You're just the kind of a boy who would always play fair
I'm just the kind of a girl who would never be square
It's so hard to let you go
But it's only because I know
That you're not the kind of a boy
That you're not the kind of a boy
That you're not the kind of a boy for a girl like meYou might also likeEmbed
