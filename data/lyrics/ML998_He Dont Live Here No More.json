 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsHe Don\u2019t Live Here No More LyricsGot a ticket on the mainline\nI was stranded on the fault line\nI got wasted on the moonshine\nToo far gone\n\nI was walking in the sundown\nI was heading for the breakdown\nWhen you're sleeping on the cold ground\nToo far gone\n\nThere was a cloud hanging over me\nSomething just reached out and grabbed a hold of me\n\nInside of the belly of the whale\nOutside they was beatin on the door\nSomebody goin down tonight\nI said boys he don't live here no more\nHe don't live here no more\n\nI was riding on the night train\nI been moving in the fast lane\nI was only trying to kill the pain\nToo far gone\n\nI was running on a red light\nYou might also likeAlways looking for a street fight\nI was higher than a lost kite\nToo far gone\n\nWhen you're waiting for the axe to drop\nWhen you're hooked so bad you could not stop\n\nInside of the belly of the whale\nOutside they was beatin on the door\nSomebody goin down tonight\nI said boys he don't live here no more\nHe don't live here no more\n\nGot no one to blame but myself\nThey couldn't hear my distant cry for help\n\nInside of the belly of the whale\nOutside they was beatin on the door\nSomebody's goin down tonight\nI said boys he don't live here no more\nHe don't live here no moreEmbed"
