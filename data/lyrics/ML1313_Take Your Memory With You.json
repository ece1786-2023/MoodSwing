 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsTake Your Memory With You Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI can read the writing on the wall\nYou pretend that nothing's changed at all\nI've got just one thing to ask you if it's so\nJust take your memory with you when you go\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I won't have to think about\nThe lonely nights I'll be without\nSomeone to hold me when the cold wind blows\nTake your memory with you when you go\n\n[Verse 2]\nI walk the floor and wonder what went wrong\nI'll have to find a way to carry on\nWhy don't you leave before the heartache starts to show\nTake your memory with you when you go\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I won't have to think about\nThe lonely nights I'll be without\nSomeone to hold me when the cold wind blows\nTake your memory with you...\n\n[Tag]\nSo I won't have to miss you\nTake your memory with you when you goYou might also likeEmbed"
