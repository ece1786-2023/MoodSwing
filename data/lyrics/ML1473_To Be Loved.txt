4 ContributorsTo Be Loved Lyrics[Verse 1]
Someone to care
Someone to share
Lonely hours and moments of despair
To be loved, to be loved (To be loved)
Oh what a feeling to be loved

[Verse 2]
Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day
To be loved, to be loved (To be loved, to be loved)
Oh what a feeling to be loved

[Bridge]
Some wish to be a king or a queen
Some wish for fortune and fame
But to be, truly, truly, truly loved is
More than all of these things, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away to hear from each day
To be loved, to be loved (To be loved, to be loved)
Oh what a feeling to be loved
To be loved, to be loved, oh what a feeling (To be loved, to be loved)
