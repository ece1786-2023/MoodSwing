[Verse]
Come ride with me through the veins of history
I'll show you a god who falls asleep on the job
And how can we win when fools can be kings?
Don't waste your time, or time will waste you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
