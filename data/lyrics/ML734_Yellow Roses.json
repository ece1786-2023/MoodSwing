 "lyrics": "7 ContributorsYellow Roses Lyrics\"Hello,\" you said the day we met\nHanding me a yellow rose\nYou asked me out and to your surprise\nAnd to mine, I said I'd go\nI thought it so romantic\nAnd I found you sweet and bold\nThough we'd only met\nI still said yes to a single yellow rose\n\nAnd for years to come, you were the one\nTo sleep with me at night\nTo laugh and talk and share my thoughts\nAnd hold me when I'd cry\nAnd on every rare occasion\nAnd for no good reason too\nA big bouquet or a single yellow rose\nWas sent from you\n\nYellow roses\nThe color of sunshine\nYou loved me at one time\nWhy did you have to go?\nYellow roses\nAre you sending your new love\nMy bright yellow rose buds?\nI still love you so\nYou might also likeI never see a yellow rose\nThat I don't think of you\nIt's still my favorite flower\nThough the yellows turned to blue\nThe day you left, my teardrops fell\nUpon your farewell note\nYou said goodbye like you said hello\nWith a single yellow rose\n\nYellow roses\nThe color of sunshine\nYou loved me at one time\nWhy did you have to go?\nYellow roses\nAre you sending your new love\nMy bright yellow rose buds?\nI still love you so\n\nYellow roses\nThe color of sunshine\nYou loved me at one time\nWhy did you have to go?\nYellow roses\nAre you sending your new love\nMy bright yellow rose buds?\nI still love you soEmbed"
