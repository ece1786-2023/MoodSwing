Better not, much too busy\nYou'd better hurry, my how time does fly\nAnd in the distance the ringing of laughter\n(Willie Nelson)\nAnd in the midst of the laughter he cries\n\n[Chorus: Kenny Chesney & Willie Nelson]\nPretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue\nWrap your presents to your darling from you\nPretty pencils to write I love you\nPretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue\nPretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue\nWrap your presents to your darling from you\nPretty pencils to write I love you\nPretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue\nOh, pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blueSee Kenny Chesney LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also likeEmbed"
