5 ContributorsOutlaw LyricsFrom San Jose to East L.A
I'm a motorcycle rider, a highway flier
I'm an outlaw, baby
Just an outlaw

I've got a girl in L.A. town
And every time I ride around
I'm an outlaw, baby (outlaw)
Just an outlaw (outlaw, baby)

Police on my tail, living on my trail
Police on my tail, living on my trail
I'm an outlaw, baby (outlaw)
Just an outlaw (outlaw, baby)

Can't be trusted, I can't get busted
I can't be trusted, but I can't get busted
I'm an outlaw, baby (outlaw)
Just an outlaw (outlaw, baby)

And it seems like (seems like)
Yes it seems like (seems like)
I'm on the run now (run now)
I'm on the run now (run now)
Yes it seems like (seems like)
Yes it seems like (seems like)
I'm on the run now (run now)
I'm on the run now (run now)

The FBI, the CHP, the DMV, coming after me
I'm an outlaw, baby (outlaw)
Just an outlaw (outlaw, baby)

In and out of trouble, lovin' on my mind
Got no time for talkin' 'cause the sheriff's close behind
I'm an outlaw, baby (outlaw)
Just an outlaw (outlaw, baby)

I spend my nights drinkin' whiskey and beer
All the pretty women know I'm here
I'm the outlaw, baby (outlaw)
Just an outlaw (outlaw, baby)
And it seems like (seems like)
Yes it seems like (seems like)
I'm on the run now (run now)
