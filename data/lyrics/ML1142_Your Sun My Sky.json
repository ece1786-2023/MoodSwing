 "lyrics": "2 ContributorsYour Sun My Sky LyricsWhat is left for us to say between hello and goodbye\nAny day now you'll close the door, and walk away\nI'll be picking through the pieces and wondering how it came to this\nIf things don't go the way you want it\nWell that's the way it goes\n\nThese photographs remind me\nOf all the things I said\nAnd the promises I made you\nOn the day that we first met\nBut ain't that just like you baby\nAin't that just like you\nAin't that like you\n\nUsed to be your sun in my sky\nIt's all over and the days go by\nUsed to be your sun in my sky\nIt ain't been easy to slowly watch you go\n\nI wonder if you know just what you're doin' to me\nKnowing what we've been through before, what am I say\nYou've been acting strangely lately, so far away yet you're next to me\nWhen things are not the way they should be\nGotta know when to let it go\n\nThese photographs remind me\nOf all the things I said\nAnd the promises I made you\nOn the day that we first met\nBut ain't that just like you baby\nAin't that just like you\nAin't that like you\nYou might also likeUsed to be your sun in my sky\nIt's all over and the days go by\nUsed to be your sun in my sky\nIt ain't been easy to slowly watch you go\n\nYou been doing me wrong\nBut I'd have you back if it were mine to choose\nYou been doing me wrong\nBut I'd still have you back if it were mine to choose\nUsed to be your sun in my sky\nIt's all over and the days go by\nUsed to be your sun in my sky\nIt ain't been easy to slowly watch you go\n\nUsed to be your sun in my sky\nTill the clouds came over and the night set in\nUsed to be your sun in my sky\nIt ain't been easy to slowly watch you go, oh noEmbed"
