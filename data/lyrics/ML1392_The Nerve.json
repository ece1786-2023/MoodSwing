[x3]\n\n[Verse 2]\nCan you believe this world's like a glassy eyed swiller caught sipping another one?\nCan you believe this world's like a tyrant taking over anything that it wants?\nCan you believe this world's like a wounded martyr worried if his commitment is gone?\nCan you believe this world's like a vagrant in the gutter talking nothing is wrong?\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nCan you believe this world's just a double dealing joker, going to stick to his guns?\nCan you believe this world's just a television blaring, a million devils at once?\nCan you believe this world's just a charmer in disguise with a lavender soul?\nCan you believe this world's just exactly as we built it, running out of control?\nYou might also like[Chorus]Embed"
