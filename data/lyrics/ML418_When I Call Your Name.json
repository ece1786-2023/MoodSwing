 "lyrics": "8 ContributorsWhen I Call Your Name Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI rushed home from work like I always do\nI spent my whole day just thinking of you\nWhen I walked through the front door, my whole life was changed\n'Cause nobody answered when I called your name\n\n[Verse 2]\nA note on the table that told me goodbye\nIt said you'd grown weary of living a lie\nOh, your love has ended but mine still remains\nBut nobody answers when I call your name\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, the lonely sound of my voice callin'\nIs drivin' me insane\nAnd just like rain, the tears keep fallin'\nBut nobody answers when I call your name\n\n[Piano Solo]\n\n[Steel Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, the lonely sound of my voice callin'\nIs drivin' me insane\nAnd just like rain, the tears keep fallin'\nBut nobody answers when I call your name\nOh, nobody answers when I call your nameYou might also likeEmbed"
