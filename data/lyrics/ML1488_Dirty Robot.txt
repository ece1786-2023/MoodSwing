1 ContributorDirty Robot Lyrics[Verse 1]
No, I don't care for your metal looks
I don't care for your bleeps and bloops
Go away, why don't you just shut up?

[Verse 2]
Your crazy smile, digital dial
I hate your every bolt and screw
I don't like anything about you

[Chorus]
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot

[Verse 3]
Yes, everyday I've been thinking 'bout you
In my dreams, we've been making out
Isn't that what human life's about? (No)

[Verse 4]
My circuitry comes off the scale
Baby, got the hots for you
My index sent a shock right through
My body needs you, my body needs you
You might also like[Chorus]
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot

[Chorus]
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, you're a dirty robot

[Chorus]
I'm a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
I'm a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
I'm a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
I'm a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot

[Refrain]
I'm a dirty robotEmbed
