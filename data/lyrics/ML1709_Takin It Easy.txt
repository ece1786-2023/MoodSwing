5 ContributorsTakinâ€™ It Easy Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind

[Chorus]
Watch that ol' moon risin' on the horizon
Turnin' from gold to blue
It's just makin' it easy for takin' it easy with you

[Verse 1]
Somewhere far away those night birds call my name
I can hear them singing love songs just for me and you
For a million summer nights this dream has been the same
It's just you and me and the stars and the sand and the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind

[Chorus]
Watch that ol' moon risin' on the horizon
Turnin' from gold to blue
Ooh, it's just makin' it easy for takin' it easy with you
You might also like[Verse 2]
Every time I look into your emerald eyes
I just want to take you far away
'Cause I know you deserve to live in paradise
And, babe, you know I'll get you there someday

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind

[Chorus]
Watch that ol' moon risin' on the horizon
Turnin' from gold to blue
It's just makin' it easy for takin' it easy with you

[Outro]
I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behindEmbed
