6 ContributorsNames of People (Chapter 1) Lyrics
Yeah!
If I gave you pretty enough words
Could you paint a picture of us that works
With emphasis on function rather than design
Aren't you tired? 'Cause I will carry you
On a broken back and blown out knees
I have been where you are for a while
Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream
All the stars right out of the sky
And destroy the prettiest starry night
Every evening that I die
I am exhumed, just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed, just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed, just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed, just a little less human
After all these images of pain have cut right through you
I will kiss every scar and weep, you are not alone
Then I'll show you that place in my chest where my heart
Still tries to beat, it still tries to beat
Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream
All the stars right out of the sky
And destroy the prettiest starry night
Every evening that I die
Live! Love! Burn! Die!
Live! Love! Burn! Die!
Live! Love! Burn! Die!
Live! Love! Burn! Die!Embed
