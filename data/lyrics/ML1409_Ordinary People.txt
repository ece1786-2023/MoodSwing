3 ContributorsOrdinary People Lyrics[Chorus]
I’m, I'm just ordinary people
Who found extraordinary love
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That God keeps lovin’ me so much

[Verse One]
There are so many people I look up to
Used to tell them I wanna be just like you
Then God took ordinary me and gave me a chance
And every day I gotta thank him for where I am

[Chorus]
(Cause I’m) I'm just ordinary people (Said I’m just, ordinary)
Who found extraordinary love (Who found, oh)
Sometimes it's hard to believe (Sometimes)
That God keeps lovin’ me so much (That God keeps lovin’ me so much)

[Verse Two]
I looked in the mirror, I saw average
You looked down from heaven, you saw a gift
Still can't figure out why you
Loved me so but that's what makes you God
I guess I’ll never know cause

[Chorus]
I'm just ordinary people (I'm just ordinary people, yes I am)
Who found extraordinary love (Who found extraordinary love)
Sometimes it's hard to believe (Yeah, yeah)
That God keeps lovin’ me so much (Keeps on lovin’ me, oh)

[Bridge]
Listen to me, I can tell you how it goes (How it goes)
God can take a nobody who no one knows (Oh, yeah)
Make 'em more than you ever could be (Ooh)
Ask me how I know
He did it for me

[Chorus]
I'm just ordinary people (I'm just ordinary, oh)
