5 ContributorsCollide Lyrics[Intro: Kid Rock]
You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were
We wouldn't be in this place tonight

[Verse 1: Kid Rock, Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow]
Lost and lonely, scared and confused
We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight
Well, it cuts like a knife, these bad luck blues
We both got scars from the hell we been through, oh
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose

[Chorus: Kid Rock, Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow]
So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, we'll hold on tight, as we collide

[Verse 2: Sheryl Crow, Sheryl Crow & Kid Rock, Kid Rock]
Reconnected, feeling no pain
Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (Ooh yeah)
Worn and weathered, scared to go home
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight, oh (Oh-oh, yeah)
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused
The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze now
Most people don't, but some people do

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, we'll hold on tight, as we collide
As we collide

[Outro: Sheryl Crow, Kid Rock, Sheryl Crow & Kid Rock]
Oh
So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, we'll hold on tight, as we collide
As we collide, oh, as we collide
As we collide, we collide
As we collide, as we collide
As we collide
Ooh,  as we collide
As we collide, as we collide
As we collideAs we collideMhm3Embed
