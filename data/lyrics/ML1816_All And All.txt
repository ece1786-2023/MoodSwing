8 Contributors(You Are My) All & All Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you and I first met
I thought you were my all and all, and all
To me, I felt no sweat
To be your all and all, and all
The way I feel for you
Is somewhat of a dream come true
For you, I will stand tall
Because you are my all and all

[Pre-Chorus]
There are times that I'm with you
That I never want to go
There are days that I missed you
But I never let it show
All I want to do is please you
I never want to let you go
You just say that you need me
And our love will grow and grow

[Chorus]
You
You are my all and all
For you, for you, I will stand tall
You
I love you most because
Boy, you, you are my all and all

Into your world, for me
Is the place that I want to be
I want to be
Inside your heart, take me
Try my love
And I'm sure you'll see
That the way I feel about you
Everyone in love should feel
I'm so crazy about you
Try my love, lets make this real

[Pre-Chorus]
All I want to do is please you
I never want to let you go
You just say that you need me
And our love will grow and grow

[Chorus]
You
You are my all and all
For you, for you, I will stand tall
You
I love you most because
Boy, you, you are my all and all

You are my all and all
For you, for you, I will stand tall

I love you most because
Boy, you, you are my all and all

For you, for you, I will stand tall
