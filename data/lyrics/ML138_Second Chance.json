When love makes a sound, babe\n(A heart needs a second chance...) Don't put me down, babe\nYou've been gone, I've been in a trance\nThis heart needs a second chance\nDon't say it's over, I just can't say goodbye\n\n(A heart needs a second chance...) When love makes a sound, babe\n(A heart needs a second chance...)\n(A heart needs a second chance...) When love makes a sound, babe\n(A heart needs a second chance...)\n(A heart needs a second chance...) Yeah\n(A heart needs a second chance...)\n(A heart needs a second chance...)1Embed"
