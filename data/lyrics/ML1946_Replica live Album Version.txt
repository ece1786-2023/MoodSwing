2 ContributorsBig jimmy 16 5 LyricsI can do this a hundred times a day times ten/
So big ask Thomas Hobbes I was there when he wrote Leviathan/
Guard my noble causes/
A fighter for virtue and love/
Pursuit of peace and charm/
Ready to love you down and put you to sleep but I’m not the song/
Hitting bongs rioting for endearing sins with efficacy and conviction/
Forced luck automatically becomes bad luck/
For the industry to become healthy it goes from sicken dispositions/
Strident students of erudition on the path to perdition I’m far from the avenue of loose intentions/
Are you ready player one?/
Yes I am are you coming to planet earth to get an underhanded curse/
Crush anybody in my way to attain this immovable and unstoppable grace/
Setting the pace to relay information on unacknowledged subject/
Browsing traces of unnamed files to learn about chemical imbalances that was found inside tombs where they see malice’s/
Miraculous paintings touched by angels of will verified and identified by tactless deals

Let me enclose this verse of perfection smothered in positive dope to smoke/
Fear of the unknown clones and I’m closer to death/
In the desert of dreams thirsty for a drink I sprint now/
A vessel of truth to embody and share with the masses /
Making level headed decisions of how I am going to reconcile opposite offers:
I’m the prince and the pauper/
I am ever lasting like the gob stopper/
Pop her locker well I never been to Harlem but I’m her Globetrotter/
Not my name but I felt like win the Oscar/
Let me be the champion of this cause so win this round in my boxer going looney Hippity Hopper/
Practice what you preach and teach I’m here to exist you just cease/
I’m an artist at a western rodeo ready to draw my hand/
Finishing touches on my endgame/
Disappear and reappear my madness is magic/
Hold on tight I’m ready to think write speak poetically upgraded and about to graduate/
Let essay this over the turntables/
Scouting for talent this non violent is once in a lifetime what Aliyah said/
You might also likeI don’t care who you are or where your from/
I see high society they’re healthy wealthy and dumb like the stooges so I’m numb/
How could I be so cumbersome/
Let me essay my target and depict me the assailant/
I nailed it didn’t fail it just flailed it/
I’m a vivid detailed picture that you can see so be amused/
When I spit this Cyborg dyslexic cypher playing with a rubiks cube /
Never addicted to no nicotine on a neon street with a cyber security leak /
Next to a quirky shrink who shrieks havoc/
I’m doing fantastic like mr. so thanks for asking/
A repetitive cross over from every genre relaxing my feet up in the Ramada formulating cures for my aching and aging sagas in Romania/
Sinister projects without much chit chat only to be stewed in Virginia witchcraft/
Backwoods thinking got me outside looking at the box thinking/
For a moment my patience was on a tight rope so let me spin my sonnets/
A din won an award once they laced a genius on it/
They Gunn a swarm like a thousand hornets for my performance/
Enhance my space big house nice pool some tunes to groove on let the melody play so I can be like a camera lens and zoom in/


More romantic than the three languages Spanish French and Italian/
My suburban living is heroic giving my troop uplifting divid ends I’m splendid kid in a German sense/
A Japan hut with a Jamaican quiet queens touch/
Eating shrimp scamp a major mage genie lamp watch lady n the tramp/
Prague and niece I’m on the way and get to the Eritrean I’m soon be seeing/
Everything I say is hypnotizing and continues to be conflicted constricted righteous and rigid exposed on contingent in lay mans terms/
My pseudonym is my nickname big the old soul yo we can go blow for blow/
See you on death row for trying to pawn off and plagiarize my lyrics as your own a fake dr writing prescriptions like Mario/
Scribbling down ideas on my trek was an epic one to recount seeing this epidemic get faster as I drummed up this epiphany to have a destiny and a fetishized wordplay/
This chiseled quartz looks real but it is secretly ersatz/
Made it this far at my point of eureka you reek of sorrow see you tomorrow /
I feel bad for the euphemism and the youth in asia(euthanasia)/
Let be here for the clarity of the sport then become evanescent/
Here we go I’m moving like a turtle on the beach to slow so I won’t get arrested by this ex officio/
You just excoriated my heroic entrance /
Them charges were excruciating but now the judge exculpated all of them/

Your can not stay here now you are expatriated/
Crimes committed were heinous dangerous and extemporaneous to say the least /
Medical medieval dark ages kept my soul in agonizing pain when I left/
Now there is none like Agatha Christie’s novel/
Yeah I see a thief run in a Jeep tired in deep mud seeking his Fiefdoms/
I’m just an apparent figment of your imagination when I display figurative rhymes/
Before college elders would give me an acknowledged head nod a simple sign of foreknowledge /
Katanas strike fear in those fools who shake like maracas and always ignite some damn fracas/
Look is in an aura or a wave of frisson/
I can’t see my rival he might become fugacious/
Read a few pages of biblical scriptures on my furlough from work/
Too many gaps and gaffs when start to possess my raps issue them on waxing walls /
Let me fix this with some gaiety and recover this gainsay/
This gamut stretches video games to Shakespearean Hamlet so I gambol those pamphlets/
Think sinking motion pockets empty and my trade of work to finance my bills was garroted/
With my pencil made out of England steel my manners stern mixed with a knighting hood of genteel/
I’m waiting patient to endure this forthcoming gradation to my admiration/
Ain’t nothing like your mom and ain’t

Grappling with uncertainty haunts me at night when searching for grandiose solutions/
I made it to the top of my rank I feel so harangue/
I’m a genius within a heterogeneous fit in this world perplexed by the media’s contusion and rallying up for s revolution of mind body and soul /
Commence to hew then resew the chapters of our lives delicately/
Let me address this social in media res before I expose fearless antagonists/
In essence the raps I display are full of vivid vindictive images and incandescent/
All my ally’s turned to enemies feel fiendish and try to upset us but I won’t let us dissolve/
I’m tiresome from guessing along with gyrating about homeless problems/
My frustration was communicated to my comrades by liaison/
My plans digressed and fell backwards got hassled then began to ramshackle/
Backfiring my telepathic dreams inserting computerized and fixed signals on temples/
Those clothes were the zeitgeist in the Great Depression I’m late for my blessings/
A needle in a haystack rewind my playback for this wheedle/
Grant me the space so it can vouchsafed/
Screw a motive to carry out bosses orders is my votive/
I need some logos on my boat lift oh shit/
It flatters me cause sometimes I’m broke in my scene it’s vogue but for show and tell my shoes are brogue/
I play the game not the rappers name but I’ll twist a (twist ya) sista and watch you undress your soul through a vista/
Viscid places and distant faces/
Look at this facade in the mirage it’s kind of odd looking at her visage not eating sausage/
I love the arts my nickname should have been Virtu I never meant to hurt you/
Be careful what you wish for it’s somber going from filthy rich to piss poor/
Indivisible my birth rights undeniable your just a bunch of bull jam packed/
Im not even vincible/
D like a school kids lunch able/
I brought to the party a maiden of truth when she was sagacious in her youth/
To swallow your pride and humble yourself you will need a tablespoon/
Don’t sweat my unique technique as you read this vignette/
This gambit in the pit let it enervate it’s speech/
A definite classic remorseful and resourceful as it gets/
Why lie cause these colors don’t die/dye so by cause you can’t vie/
And I remain an explicit dude real rude mouth full of vicissitudes/
Behave child and be a nice boy cause here comes the Viceroy/

My love send letters are prestige indeed they cling to shingles that are now vestige/
Best believe when I walk into a room I come in peace/
Who’s next to go up this vertex in present context/
Show me my acting cue because I’m set all this questions they asked me I gave me back in verisimilitude/
Back in denial the skies of my dreams red and blue but now I’m in venial/
Mind altering substances making my mentality vendible and bendable/
A velvet night I said it once don’t make it twice/
Urchin looks leave to capsize my adventure with urgent crooks/
Hot like the smogs from the pyro in the nostrils of Spyro don’t be mad I’m just a Tyro/
Eat my own flow like a gyro I don’t know so I’m about to blow up Egypt I’m thinking Cairo with some high flow on a oops that was a typo baby I’m a psycho from Ohio/
My heart and brain have gave out doctors and surgeons trying to revive me/
Like Christmas it’s a cheerful spirit when I kick this verse with ya nurse /
Met a fake replica of a man named Erica who was not from America/
On my list I have to usher out this gist I solemnly swear to spit as I sear and swelter raps before my tryst /
Throwing a tantrum that’s tantamount to a child won’t help you either/
Crisp fresh brew a hint of apple cider/
Facial expression truculent and my meal was far from succulent /
I am but my my Spider-Man senses and mood changes all the time/
I need a love of my own but now I ain’t a average white band
All in ample time sipping some maple syrup within the confines of my soul as I attempt victorious strides/
I’m going back to the old me since we ain’t on good termagant terms again/
Reciting and inciting hot lines on my lawn at my chateau beside the tableau/

A jar of of greed and a pot for my need /
I want what I want so stunt my back has no front/
I like to see a battle of wits Donald trump vs forest gump vs chuck norris sun/
Let me get the message straight so it won’t be fixed for fusion then get knocked by a fissure then I put the binary back into a fission as I’m fishing then she likes math class cause I’m here long division/
A notorious rap performance coming with cosmic weapons that’s my squad rep pin/
Official scholars of adversity find my flow hard to answer like a mystery suicidal murder/
I’m just a kid enchanted by your magic in an incubus related to Icarus /
See you later Roy I’m not a toy I’m fully focused my route I want my Paperboy/
Hotter than a cup of java don’t Botha in Turkey sweet tooth someone pass me the Baklava/
My Servants are loyal I’m polished with the finest oil and if must wear my crown to be royal/
Wanna place ya bets I’m a gift in real rare form from the French my new name is Lafayette/
Play me turn up the radio cause I wanna know what’s on my cassette eject don’t flex come correct I abject now spit into the mic and read the alphabet/
Drinking from the front finest winery separating my fake and truth in my refinery/

My depression state reclines and unwinds for the given time/
My anxiety takes over my Central nervous system/
I’m part paralyzed and am getttti nag uh speech impediment/
No more schizophrenia now I’m eating a lot more than I chew/
Tied to my inner sick narcissistic self mirroring my reality/
My thoughts are graphical then go skinny like I’m entering anorexia/
Bars scattered all over the mixed up could be early signs of dyslexia/
Please park your breaks pumping don’t let these naysayers get the best of ya/
I’m young generating Alzheimer’s on documented papers so I sign there/
This flow is mine in a neat form I’m ocd for sure this too neat/
Look no Aspergers in my 16 bars unless there’s some form of autism in my bars/
This separation anxiety is upon on trial awaiting its notoriety/
Can’t keep focused the picture foggy ADHD symptoms triggering my career/
Can’t hope it won’t be quoted just be heroic and stoic pleas not protozoic/
My style range is simple I’m can go from being on a street corner/
Suited down 3 pc on live tv talking to a fox republican news reporter/

I’m from Maryland my state 301 is where I’m recording /
And I have big dreams to the hip hop version with expressions like Ed Norton/
My jewels are bright but my flight out of orbit we abortin/
You get extorted for not being able to afford it/
Let me aboard the ship and distort this flick/
Go to the judge and report this snitch/
In the walk of fame I’m a star now let support my hit/
My flow hotter in the streets than on stage shucks my bars hotter than a battle like Cassidy vs Eminem/
Too much to bicker and noisy banter/
I’m cool jack laid back legs up with glasses on and some black glasses on playing the theme from pink panther /
Cut the product and middleman in the store out so I could it it straight no whole sale/
Null and void when it makes the mail/
Under pressure I’m good at conspiracy theories you won’t see traces of me in the sky like chem trails/
Dosing off on the side line seeking some thick tails/
I’m a brag about you put a post on my book then snap a pic about you/
Words on tablets from cavemen every sentence I meant it set in stone now I carry my statue/

My lines my bars are hand written and I’m loud when I tip toe around the live show/
You can get super hard like that scene where that native radishes his eye brow you know Apacalypto/
Paid in full but I’m not big money Mitch/
Full of comedy delivering 16s in nine months like babies I’m a dr call me Kosevich/
When I was down and out my baby momma took care of me/
My own family and friends hated on me they was like the Pharisees/
On my own way to stardom reaching success I’m a rare breed/
Look closer then pick the stems out the weed cause if you don’t then you got ripped off indeed/
I’m something big the mayor need to see/
Player please I been around you just didn’t know me since we graduated Cooley High/
Hutches over scratching my head making a hunch about this/
On a run depicted as a fugitive really grasping life on its terms/
Since you don’t want beef I guess your a vegetarian/
But you gotta knuckle up like The Warriors or your body is the casket you get buried in/
I don’t try to fit or stand out I just do me/
Because a man that’s spits like big Jim is not going drive an 2018 yellow Audi/

Do your own thing a different avenue can get you that different cash/
High School and college was something I did pass/
Focused on me not worrying about what them other dudes do/
Shit I tell em just do you cause /
They gonna hate on you when you cruise that 2018 BMW/
Avoiding all the losers games jail kids you can’t take of and drugs/
Eating my money up giving into bs/
Next time I put sixteens down paper I need a bank to verify and co sign my rhymes/
Felt like I read this on that mag high times/
I’m on shore but I think I could hang glide/
Cause if it is a scheme and it’s cut short/
Then we express mail your corpse with a fee of course/
It’d me tighten my axel wow wait my flow is on fire like the hair of the clown on twisted metal no specters/
Left my adversaries confused when they get swirled and twirled on sand/
This is real life my ex girl took the lyrical gun and got em blown like Kirby s Dream Land/
A ball of confusion too much temptations/

You a Simpson simpleton I’m on a trek ask Homer/
Went to court for my sex scene she wanted in Latin so I gave her a pro boner/
You count my cards like you count my bars fraud/
I love my soup my special brand of cream of broccoli/
You collapse when I spit verses giving out life sentences like court cases easily/
Its a shame you have to diss people just to get your views up/
Bar x bar pound for pound for pound I astound the crowd when it cheers/
Imaginary players vs extraordinary pimps/
We as real and raw as they come out my vendor/
I’m so advanced I even was signed to Mensa/
I’m teaching my girl the tricks where’s
Shirley temple she calls me Bojangles/
You don’t have to be in the eat but I’m a dish sense my steam on this et tu fe/
It’s all just a game playing with words so my last name is smith/
Hustle flows on my tapes a beautiful mind I’m in my Russell Crowe/
Eject the elects now I direct when I dissect my butterfly see its effect/
End of story i paid alimony for testimony your baloney get clowned like homey then quote my allegory/

I’m insane in my asylum I maintain/
A war hero for hip hop rip to John McCain/
My initials are not AK/
I’m up high like the soul plane/
Oh my god what an omen/
Stay wiser than Yoda saying yahoo/
My ladies are circus freaks showing you taboo/
Stuck on me like an artists tatoo/
They want the green I appear out of thin air The great gazoo/
Do it when you die so I put a halo over you/
In my radius they play us/
Let me stretch my arms out Goro vs dr Octavia’s in the sky my ship Gradius/
A lot of liquor and great ideas/
Monster madness riding out on a grounder mustang/
Like Chinese stickers im stick when you pull me apart/
It’s too hot in the summer time to spit something cool I think/
You made a killing no guns Just my pens wielding I sit high putting in work like 1930s Manhattan construction workers on buildings/

Trump is our president/
Maryland is my residence/
My family was heaven sent/
When I leave for a long time I’m home sick/
Outside roasting marshmallows on an open fire/
Ice cold winds and razor sharp flies whistle/
Body aches metal plates commence to whittle/
Sheets of loose leaf paper I write my diary on/
Apron on big Jim marinate and serenade the juices when they burst/
16 bars in mansion haunted watch out for the ghost/
A rumor that ain’t real it was just a hoax/
It is spiteful to be you cause your arrogance will over turn/
I play for keeps you take the losses/
Great things comes those who wait patiently/
When you rush the adrenaline rises my blood pressure levels/
My name ain’t Melvin second round I want helpings and your my family but no Cosby show like Elvin/

You can be rich or poor/
You can want peace or war/
You can’t get your time back but you can but everything in the store/
Time goes on we let bygones go and change our perspective at the door/
Listen up I could have died fighting/
But god chose me for a different course/
I could have chose the drug route but instead I used my mind to find my fountain of youth/
I’m a genius when I’m on the mic/
If it’s good for me to utilize than I want it plain and simple/
I got one liners that strike fast like the ice climbers/
Them hits take you back to the past did you use a pipe to smoke/
I’m on shore rapping with straight bars I’m a dead toad/
These wanna be’s are flops that just croak/
Poof I’m gone whodini in the land of Miami fine exotic ladies in many mini bikinis/
Going to my hardship carrying a soft chip on my shoulder eating a starfish/
Watch out I got a fever and I’m ready to explode at at a marksman/

The only thing I dread is the judge I’m about to see so like the board game it’s in the Risk/
Drink my flow up it’s brisk/
Return of the Jedi in my brothers Levi we fly high against the sith/
Dominate the landscape rise to the occasion I brought my ape/
A grizzly bear on the loose about to chew you to smithereens/
I’m on live tv screen hitting you around the cypher but I’m not butter bean/
Be you in your rhymes find your own style don’t try to be like some else/
Imitating demonstrating and elevating off their lives was not wise/
I’m a child so I’m always learning to adjust to this maladaptive environment/
My mom name is penny and dad name is Trent/
Never been to France but I can understand their accent when they need the rent/
On a Gondola passing to go see the magnificent works of art the country reproduced/
Four more times I fight for my champion belt/
A stampede roaring in causing some wobbling welts/
To each is his or her own/
Lights off when I kill these two idiots with idioms using one stone my skills are hone/

I don’t care I’m the new mayor/
To be the boss you got to pay the fare so on act lasseiz you hear/
Life comes with a price for most of us it ain’t fair/
My hustle is rare so cross me I double dare/
Yo I’m a clown having sex on my birthday I’m Jack Napier/
God please forgive me for all my sin/
My guilty conscious brings them back to life bright like the hat on the Gortons fisherman/
Support my supply and demand principal/
I’m the one they call official but I ain’t a school principle/
All on point feeding my family in my municipal/
You can tell I’m real not fake by the way I was created look at the visual/
Jimmy Mack tell them you’ll be back so just relax facts take off tax/
A glitch in the system another matrix computer hack/
In my card game it’s this gambit now I love to be the winner jack/
Higher than the kite Franklin flew/
Oldies but goodies some Aretha tunes/
Never met drake but I’ll still his views/

My style is a one knockout piece hitter quitter/-
The tables turned like a do scratching when we last met/
I’m not a street fighter or a general like bison/
But I’m stuck in space talking about physics Neil Degrasse tyson/
My bank account is broke but after the show I hope to see some ones/
It’s all fun and games till it happens to you/
I stay in programs to perfect my craft even after school/
I’m smart like a fish I need to eat my mackerel hear my mouth start to crackle/
Lounge in my own thoughts and zoning in my own mind/
I made an offer you can’t refuse/
I’m not amused by you comical stupid dudes/
Tell the truth I’m tired of these bills and over repeated flukes/
I don’t smoke for free and I don’t sell bars/
You want some I cook em for you then get you the wholesale/
Fresh out my oven you can smell and inhale the scent of oatmeal:/
Lemon colored car seats and golden plated rims is what I’m on/

Before you can back out I stand firm in my conviction/
You ain’t got a PhD like dr Mario fraud but you say you sorry though/
Big Jim my other alias should have been collage/
I’m all over the place painting many ideas from an art class in college/
This a Herculean cyclops in the eye of the storm mixed with a cyclone/
I always hung around the older crew cause if I hang with the younger dudes I might lose/
Life can bring you psi. Or joy so I’ll pick joy/
Just dint get upset if your batteries die out like a gameboy/
No more acting a role like the new 007 with an English accent Idris Elba/
German women going angry in public Hey Arnold vs Helga/
In the south I’m watching a movie turn on Selma/
What’s Louise without Thelma/
A genius mind always finding hints go jinkies I’m Velma/
I keep a green hat on my head and a sword but I’m not Zelda/
This new era might be the death of me/
Always ask questions never take what they tell you/

Big jim the Collage

My comedies are corrupted in my bars not a Shakespeare scholar but I can go measure for measure/
I’m going to past all the tests of time/
I been around since sonic was on secs genesis and since Hercules ride on his horse Pegasus/
I’m trying to move a million plus units on my album release date/
I want pockets full of money cholesterol and a pinch of lime cheesecake/
I want so my much money my knees and back ache/
Like when a kid gets in trouble you make that sarcastic gee just great face/
A mythical creature about to get your chest torn in on point with this beat I’m a unicorn/
Turn around it gets scary so make a wish then poof you I got a fairy/
I know what I think I saw you iron ship sink in the desert right behind a sphinx wearing a mink that’s pink/
If my skin dries I put on aloe Vera my flow from the Sahara I take all animals I even own a chimera/
I’m flyer than a griffin so don’t test me/
Or come meet my inner beast a Yeti/
Driving you mad in my car I’m half man half beast like a centaur or come with bull strength I’m a centaur/
In office like I’m running for senator/
Every word and verse I wrote I mean this/
I keep three dope bars with their own heads like a cerebrus/
Wings of a winter Phoenix or I might fight ya like I’m a hydra so hide ya kids/

I hop on the mic to speak something tactical practical and factual/
But you just fly by passing your history class like some prehistoric Pterodactyl/
Don’t get brainwashed by the medi critics or the hype/
They use their conditions as scapegoats and recycle the same gloomy quotes/
Like a student in class I’m taking taking down advanced notes/
I’m sharp in the mind I should be hosting wedding receptions/
Or presiding over general presidential elections/
Invest in me you will see guaranteed results I can sell and tell you/
Life is a trail we all must travel to get to our location/
I’m in my mood changing modes in my PlayStation/
Don’t know the next spot but I planned my vacation/
I got something on my mind someone say they can see it in my eyes/
Why fight back when I can give back to the mess I lived in/
The joke is not on me it’s on you/
Nightlife I skate pass my nephews curfew/
John Doe no name everybody is saying who are you I’m like I’m just me fool/

I got an idea let’s play this like a scene from Madea /
I’m cooking up bars serving my fiends in the lunch cafeteria/
I’m more like Patrick Ewing who are you suing you look clueless/
You need a q tip in your ear to remove the ear wigs/
Be careful kids cause this is an auto didactic manual reaction/
I’m afraid of getting hurt again I stay away from dirty dancing at clubs biker Gangs ripped jeans and pool sticks/
Don’t get caught up in the hustle like you riding fast on a motorcycle/
In school I was never the most popular/
But I created my own style something afar you need a to see with a pair of binoculars/

I got the Briefcase deal or no deal like I’m Howie Mandel/
The steam on my plate of food is very hot I can sense extreme pressure/
You are fresher but my mentality is way better how clever/
Pull you back in to the game again so I broke the factory lever/
Every line stitched tightly and bar on the track is treasure/
Besides why would I want to give my trash if you don’t see the gold in front of you?/
Tonight there’s just good vibes all love and no fights about stress or strife/
Prepare for the prevention of premonition ms of your first day/
And the clairvoyance I seen as I play my flute it puked or flunked/
But my xylophone and harmonica are figuratively synced/Embed
