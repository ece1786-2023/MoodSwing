4 ContributorsTime After Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick, and think of you
Turning in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback to warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time afterâ€”

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you have said
And you say, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
You might also like[Verse 3]
After your picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
I'm wondering if you're okay
And you say, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The drum beats out of time

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time

[Outro]
Time after time (Mmm)
Time after time (Ooh)
Time after time
Time after timeEmbed
