4 ContributorsPlease, Please Baby Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, hang on a second
Yeah, hang on the to the rhythm, buddy

[Chorus]
Please, please baby, baby, come back home
I's so cold and dark here all alone
If you come back, I promise I'll be good
If you come home, baby, I'll act like I should

[Verse 1]
I laughed when you packed your bags
And told me goodbye
I hollered "I don't need you"
Oh, but honey that's a lie

[Chorus]
Please, please baby, baby, come back home
It's so cold and dark here all alone
If you come back, I promise I'll be good
If you come home, baby, I'll act like I should

[Verse 2]
If you don't come home, dear
I know I'll go insane
Sweetheart, I plead guilty
Darlin' I'll take all the blame
