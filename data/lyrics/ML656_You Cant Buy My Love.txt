4 ContributorsYou Canâ€™t Buy My Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can give me money, diamonds and pearls
But you can't buy my love with all the money in the world

[Chorus]
You can't buy my love
No, you can't buy my love
For no money in the world
You can't buy my love

[Verse 2]
Now you're so blue
Baby, I'm so glad
'Cause you done lost
The best thing you ever had

[Chorus]
Oh, you can't buy my love
No, you can't buy my love
For no money in the world
Ooh, you can't buy my love, well

[Verse 2]
Now you're so blue
Baby, I'm so glad
'Cause you done lost
The best thing you ever had
