1 ContributorInto You Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's your voice, in my ear
It's your perfume, in the air
It's your smile, and your laugh
It's the greatest feelin' that I've ever had

[Chorus]
I'm into you, girl
I get more confident
Each time you call my name
I'm into you, ooh, girl
I guess I must admit I'm finally tuned in
I'm into you, ooh, girl

[Verse 2]
From your hair, to your toes
You're like sunshine to my soul
Every move that you make
Tastes like candy to my brain
And I'm so in love with you
And I'm hopin' you love me too
And I'm havin' such a lovely time
I get so excited, girl, you blow my mind

[Chorus]
I'm into you, girl
I get more confident
Each time you call my name
I'm into you, ooh, girl
I guess I must admit I'm finally tuned in
I'm into you
