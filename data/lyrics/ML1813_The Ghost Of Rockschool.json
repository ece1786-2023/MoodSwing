Was it just your fate?\nThere's a demon that waits at the garden gate\nIf you get past him, maybe Lawrence and Phil\nWill be waiting to take you to the ghost of rockschool\n\nEverything hums as the blue heart turns\nAnd the blue girl's dawn is when the sun goes down\nMy story tonight is from your solitude heights\nI got a window on your constellation\n\nMaster I love from the ground above\nAs the stars below, as my memory flows\nEvery picture frame is beating louder than time\nEvery clock in the hall is bending slowly\n\nShe's in her tower and she's beautiful, sure\nThe quicker you learn she has no soul to discern\nAt least no business of yours, you bear the vacuum of scars\nShe was put there to tempt you like the perfume of flowers\n\nI've seen God in the sun, I've seen God in the street\nGod before bed and the promise of sleep\nGod in my dreams and the free ride of grace\nI've seen God shining out from her reflection\nYou might also likeI've seen God in the sun, I've seen God in the street\nGod before bed and the promise of sleep\nGod in the puddles and the lane beside houses\nI've seen God shining out from her reflectionEmbed"
