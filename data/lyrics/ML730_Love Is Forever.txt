5 ContributorsLove is Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
I live the same old dream, day and night
Memories of love I knew
I couldn't live my life, or so it seemed
My heart cried out for only you

[Chorus]
Oh, I believe in love but I believe in you
Things you do
I'm falling in love again with you
A broken heart could mend if given time
I know why love is forever
Love is forever with you

[Verse 2]
With every passing day, I realize
And time will never heal the pain
You're all that I've been thinking of
Can we fall in love again?

[Chorus]
Oh, I believe in love, girl, I believe in you
Things you do
I'm falling in love again with you
A broken heart can mend if given time
I know why love is forever
Love is forever with you
You might also like[Bridge]
Every road will lead me back to you again, my love
Oh, I cried so many tears
Couldn't face another day without you
So tell me you care, oh-oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Whoa-oh, ooh-hoo, yeah

[Chorus]
I believe in love, I believe in you
Things you do
I'm falling in love again with you
Tried to let it go but it wouldn't die
I know why love is forever (Love is forever)
Love is forever with you1Embed
