We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk the tables being turned

[Verse 2]
We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always comes with getting burned

[Pre-Chorus]
But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire

[Verse 3]
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

[Verse 4]
We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all

They're so hell-bent on giving, walking a wire
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire

[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

[Bridge]
There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire

[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire2Embed
