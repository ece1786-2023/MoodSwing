I don't know\nWell, maybe I'm in love (Love)\nThink about it\nEvery time I think about it\nCan't stop thinking 'bout it\nHow much longer will it take to cure this?\nJust to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (Love)\nMakes me wanna turn around and face me\nBut I don't know nothin' 'bout love, uh\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on, come on\nTurn a little faster\nCome on, come on\nThe world will follow after\nCome on, come on\nBecause everybody's after love\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I said, I'm a snowball runnin'\nRunnin' down into the spring that's comin'\nAll this love meltin' under blue skies\nBelting out sunlight, shimmering love\nWell, baby, I surrender\nTo this strawberry ice cream\nNever-ever-ender\nAll this love\nWell, I didn't mean to do it\nBut there's no escaping your love, oh\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nThese lines of lightnin' mean we're never alone\nNever alone\nNo, no\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on, come on\nMove a little closer\nCome on, come on\nI wanna hear you whisper\nCome on, come on\nSettle down inside my love, ohh\nCome on, come on\nJump a little higher\nCome on, come on\nIf you feel a little lighter\nCome on, come on\nWe were once upon a time in love\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWe're accidentally in love, accidentally in love\nAccidentally in love, accidentally in love\nAccidentally in love, accidentally in love\nAccidentally in love, accidentally in love\nAccidentally, I'm in love, I'm in love\n[Refrain]\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nAccidentally, I'm in love, I'm in love\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nAccidentally\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on, come on (Come on)\nSpin a little tighter\nCome on, come on (Come on)\nAnd the world's a little brighter\nCome on, come on (Come on)\nJust get yourself inside her love\nI'm in love23Embed"
