1 ContributorI Hear Music Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hear music
Mighty fine music
The murmur of a morning breeze up there
The rattle of the milkman on the stair

[Verse 2]
Sure, that's music
Mighty fine music
The singing of a sparrow in the sky
The perking of the coffee right near by

[Bridge]
There's my favorite melody
You, my angel, phoning me

[Verse 3]
I hear music
Mighty fine music
And anytime I think my world is wrong
I get me out of bed and sing this song

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
I hear music
Mighty fine music
The murmur of a morning breeze up there
The rattle of the milkman on the stair
You might also like[Verse 2]
Sure, that's music
Mighty fine music
The singing of a sparrow in the sky
The perking of the coffee right near by

[Bridge]
There's my favorite melody
You, my angel, phoning me

[Verse 3]
I hear music
Mighty fine music
And anytime I think my world is wrong
I get me out of bed and sing this songEmbed
