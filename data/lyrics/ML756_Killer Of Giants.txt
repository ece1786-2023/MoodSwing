If none of us believe in war
Then can you tell me what the weapon's for?
Listen to me everyone
If the button is pushed, there'll be nowhere to run, oh
Giants, sleeping giants
Winning wars within their dreams
Till they wake when it's too late
And in God's name blaspheme

[Chorus]
Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Marches of protest not stopping the war
Or the killer of giants, the killer of giants

[Verse 2]
Mother Nature, people state your case without its worth
Your seas run dry, your sleepless eyes are turning red alert

[Chorus]
Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Rising so proudly, it has nowhere to fall
This killer of giants, this killer of giants, yeah

[Chorus]
Killer of giants threatens us all
Mountains of madness standing so tall
Marches of protest not stopping the war
Or the killer of giants, oh, the killer of giants
Killer of giants, killer of giantsEmbed
