2 ContributorsSunset Lyrics[Bengali]
হঠাৎ যদি আমি থেমে যেতাম
(Haṭhāṯ yadi āmi thēmē yētāma = If I were suddenly to stop)
শেষ বিকেলের মতো অস্ত যেতাম
(śēṣa bikēlēra matō asta yētāma =  to set beyond the horizon as dusk arrives)
অসীম রাতের শেষে শয়নে
(asīma rātēra śēṣē śaẏanē = At last, in the bed of infinite night)
[2 ×]
সূর্যের সাথে আমি ঘুমিয়ে যেতাম
(sūryēra sāthē āmi ghumiẏē yētāma = I would fall asleep with the sun)

If I were never to leave here
If I were always alone
If I were never to see you
If I could set the sun
If I could set the sun

Keep movin'
Keep changin'
Keep flowin' with the sun
Rivers rise
Oceans rise
People rise with the sun

If I were never to leave here
If I were always alone
If I would never to see you
If I could set the sun
If I could set the sun
You might also likeTears fallin'
Rain fallin'
Leaves are falling with the sun
Lives drifting
Seeds drifting
Worlds drifting with the sun

If I were never to leave here
If I were always alone
If I were never to see you
If I could set with the sunset, say it ...

If I
Never to leave here

If I
Always alone
If I

Oceans rise
Rivers rise
People rise
With the sun

Oceans rise
Rivers rise
People rise
With the sunEmbed
