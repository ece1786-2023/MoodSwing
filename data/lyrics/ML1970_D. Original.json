Original Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDirty rotten scoundrel, that's what I'm called on the street\nCould connive and cheat but rarely get beat\nYa see I'm streetwise, a con-game pro\nKickin' the Bobby bullshit, too smart for Willie Bobo\nNot stressin' five-o, hot hand in cee-lo\nLive in the land of crooks yes Brooklyn's the borough\nHomicide central, East New York\nWhere the manic depressive psycho murderers stalk\nWalk like a ninja on the asphalt\nHere talk is cheap, you're outlined in chalk\nAnd there's more hardtimes than on Good Times\nAnd most niggas dedicate their life to crime\nSo I'm steady schemin', won't work for a dime\nUsed to get tax free loot all the time\nType slick can't fess on 'Ru because\nI'm the original dirty rotten scoundrel\n\n[Verse 2]\nBefore trains were graffiti proof I used to get loose\nDirty rotten since the days of the deuce\nDirty because of the skin I'm in, the fact I have -\nMelanin automatically makes me a felon\nEven though I'm righteous rotten's what you're yellin'\nBut I'm not chain-snatchin', or drug-sellin'\nAccording to your books you said I would be damned like Ham\nScoundrel, opposite of the king that I am\nYou wanna get funny? We can get bummy\nTake you to the East and back again money\nFilthy putrefied trick, step past your sister\nChallenge the Damaja, and you'll be his-to-\nRy, Mortal Kombat fatality\nThe Original, don't sing no R&B\nNasty emcee deity, chop off domes -\nWith the poems that come out of my pi-ne-al\nGland, as I expand you know who I am\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nFather of all stylin', I be wildin' on wax\nWe hack shit up like big ax and little ax\nDon't need toast to make you jump like bungee\nTracks real muddy like Brooklyn's, real grungy\nWhen I come through I clog up your sewer\nPeep the maneuveur, drop the ill manure\nSo bring Mr. Clean, Drano, and Roto Rooter\nNo matter what you do you can't get through the Crud that comes out of your system\nYou're another victim of Dirty Rotten\nDirt up in your grill, so what ya gonna do\nBut pay homage to (homage to, homage to)...5Embed"
