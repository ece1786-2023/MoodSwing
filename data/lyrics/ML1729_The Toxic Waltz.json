The pit is it!\nYou can take your chance on this rough new dance\nIf you dare to dive in!\nThere are some that try, but they won't survive\nThey don't hit! 'Cause they're wimps!\nAnd this exercise helps you brutalise\nWith us! Exodus!\n\nEverybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz\nKick your friend in the head and have a ball\nCome on and do the Toxic Waltz\nAnd slam your partner against the wall\nEverybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz\nGood friendly, violent fun in store for all\nGet up off your ass and Toxic Waltz\nIf you hit the floor, you can always crawl!\nYou might also likeUsed to do the monkey, but now it's not cool\nThe twist and mashed potato are no exception to the rule\nSo don't be a dunce and dance like a runt\nJust throw your elbows with good friendly, violent fun\nDon't start to cry if you get a black eye\nJust dive back in and give another try\nBut too much action may leave you in traction\nSo you better get insurance no matter your endurance\n\nFlailing round and round and you're injury bound\nWaltz it up! The pit is it!\nYou can take your chance on this rough new dance\nIf you dare to dive in!\nThere are some that try, but they won't survive\nThey don't hit! 'Cause they're wimps!\nAnd this exercise helps you brutalise\nWith us! Exodus!\n\nEverybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz\nKick your friend in the head and have a ball\nCome on and do the Toxic Waltz\nAnd slam your partner against the wall\nEverybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz\nGood friendly, violent fun in store for all\nGet up off your ass and Toxic Waltz\nIf you hit the floor, you can always crawl!\n[Instrumental Break]\n\nGet up on your feet\nDon't look so obsolete\nAnd thrash like an athlete!\nDon't sit there on your ass\nDon't look like you got too much class\nYou'll be harassed!\nYou know we guarantee\nThis is the key\nSo rage or get the third degree!\nYou begin frontal assaults\nAnd start your somersaults\nAnd do the toxic waltz!\nDo the toxic waltz!\nDo the toxic waltz!\nDo the toxic waltz!\nDo the toxic waltz!1Embed"
