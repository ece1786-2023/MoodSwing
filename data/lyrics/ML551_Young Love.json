(When love was new, baby)\nDo you remember the young love?\nDo you remember the love we shared? (And we both were, too)\nDo you remember the young love? (Sugar)\nDo you remember the love we shared? (When love was new)\nDo you remember the young love? (Baby)\nDo you remember the love we shared? (And we both were, too)\nDo you remember the young love? (Sugar)\nDo you remember the love we shared? (Listen to me)\n[Outro]\nDon't you think we ought to give it one more try?\nWe've come too far to be saying\n(We've come too far to be saying) Bye\n(Young love)\nGive it on more try (Young love)\nOoh, don't you remember, baby? (Young love)\nYoung love was much better (Young love)\nOoh, my love (Young love)\nWhy you wanna grow old on me?\nWhy you wanna keep me in misery? (Young love)\nWhy you wanna say goodbye? (Young love)\nWhy you want to make me cry, baby? (Young love)\nYoung love, my love, your love\nWhy you wanna say goodbye? (Young love)\nWhy you want to make me cry, baby? (Young love)\nI'm cryin', baby\nI'm cryin', baby (Young love)\nI'm cryin', young love\nI'm cryin', young love (Young love)\nI'm cryin', young love\nI'm cryin', young love (Young love, young love)\nDon't say goodbye\nPlease2Embed"
