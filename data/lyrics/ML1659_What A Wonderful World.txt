4 ContributorsWhat a Wonderful World Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

[Verse 2]
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

[Chorus]
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
They're only saying, "I love you"

[Verse 3]
I see babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn so much more than I'll ever know
Then I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

[Chorus]
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
They're only saying, "I love you"
You might also like[Outro]
I see babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn so much more than I'll ever know
Then I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"
Then I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"Embed
