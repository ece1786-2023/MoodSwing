Hey\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBe all you can be\nThe more that you seize\nWill bring you your celebrity\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, what a killer life (It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life\nOh, what a killer life (It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life (Life), life\n\n[Verse 2]\nMm, that's how it starts, it all started right there\nWhat do you mean you need a break?\nWhat do you mean the TV needs repair?\n\"Do I have to do everything?\" he asks\nHe says, \"I'm sick, yeah, I'm sick of this\"\nSo he kills his wife and he kills his kids\nThat's what he did, hey\nSee Sheryl Crow LiveGet tickets as low as $149You might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nBe all you can be\nThe more that you seize\nWill bring you your celebrity\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, what a killer life (It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life\nOh, what a killer life (It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life\nKiller life\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 3]\nBig TV attorneys, big TV covers\nThey put him on the stand in a Calvin Klein suit\nDeals, we're making deals\nTurning wheels, trying to get our best foot in the door\nJustice, or what it seems\nHe's too nice to have done it anyway\nLife, yeah, that's life\nBut no more than seven years and eighteen days\nHe gets caught up in the videos\nMagazines and works out and finds the Lord\nHe loses the Lord and gets a book slash movie deal\nFor four, yeah, four pa\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThen he says, \"hey\nBe all you can be\nThe more that you seize\nWill bring you your celebrity\"\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, what a killer life (It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life\nOh, what a killer life (It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life (Killer)\nOh, what a killer life (It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life (Life)\nOh, what a killer life (It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life (Oh I could be anybody)\nOh, what a killer life (It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life\nOh, what a killer life (It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life (Uh)\n\n[Outro]\n(It's a killer life)\nOh, what a killer life\n(It's a killer life)\nOh, what a, oh, what a killer lifeEmbed"
