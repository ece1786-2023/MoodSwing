 "lyrics": "1 ContributorColors LyricsIt's hard for me to say what I want from\nYou I have had 22 years of\nTrying to form the words that somehow\nMight mean I am feeling\n\nSo many colors in this distraction\nBrown hair makes her lips more red\nWords would not describe what I'm seeing\nI try to hold my tongue but it's useless\n\nShe makes my heart scream color\nI know by now she should have found me out\nAnd every sense I have's been exhausted\nBut color makes her smile\n\nShe's always waiting for me to speak\nBut all she hears is whitest noise\nThough I may not communicate my heart\nShe knows the color I'm screaming\n\nShe makes my heart scream color\nI know by now she should have found me out\nAnd every sense I have's been exhausted\nBut color makes her smile\n\nI feel it coming, I feel it coming\nI feel it coming, I feel it coming\nI feel it coming, I feel it coming\nI feel it coming on\nYou might also likeWhoa, she makes my heart scream color\nI know by now she should have found me out\nAnd every sense I have's been exhausted\nBut color makes her smile (color makes her smile)\n\nYeah, she makes my heart scream color\nShe should have found me out\nAnd every sense I have's been exhausted\nBut color makes her smileEmbed"
