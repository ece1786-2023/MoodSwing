 "lyrics": "17 ContributorsSomeday You Will Be Loved Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI once knew a girl in the years of my youth\nWith eyes like the summer, all beauty and truth\nBut in the morning I fled, left a note and it read:\n\"Someday you will be loved\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI cannot pretend that I felt any regret\n'Cause each broken heart will eventually mend\nAnd as the blood runs red down the needle and thread\nSomeday you will be loved\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known\nAnd the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams\nJust a series of blurs, like I never occurred\n'Cause someday you will be loved\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou may feel alone when you're falling asleep\nAnd every time tears roll down your cheeks\nBut I know your heart belongs to someone you've yet to meet\nAnd someday you will be loved\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known\nAnd the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams\nJust a series of blurs, like I never occurred\nBut someday you will be loved\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known\nAnd the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams\nJust a series of blurs, like I never occurred\nAnd someday you will be loved\nAnd someday you will be loved2Embed"
