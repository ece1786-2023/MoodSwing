34 ContributorsTake a Bow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Corrupt, you corrupt
And bring corruption to all that you touch
Hold, you'll behold
And beholden for all that you've done

[Verse 2]
And spell, cast a spell
And cast a spell on the country you run
And risk, you will risk
You will risk all their lives and their souls

[Chorus]
And burn, you will burn
You will burn in Hell, yeah, you'll burn in Hell
You'll burn in Hell, yeah, you'll burn in Hell
For your sins

[Bridge]
Ooh, and our freedom's consuming itself
What we've become
Is contrary to what we want
Take a bow

[Verse 3]
Death, you bring death
And destruction to all that you touch
Pay, you must pay
You must pay for your crimes against the earth

And Hex, feed the Hex
Feed the Hex on the country you love
And beg, you will beg
You will beg for their lives and their souls

[Chorus]
And burn, you will burn
You will burn in Hell, yeah, you'll burn in Hell
You'll burn in Hell, yeah, you'll burn in Hell
For your sins6Embed
