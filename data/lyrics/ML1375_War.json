 "lyrics": "5 ContributorsWar Lyrics[Verse 1]\nUntil the philosophy\nWhich holds one race superior\nAnd another inferior\nIs finally and permanently\nDiscredited and abandoned\nEverywhere is war\n\n[Verse 2]\nUntil there is no longer first class\nOr second class citizens of any nation\nThat until the color of a man's skin\nIs of no more significance\nThan the color of his eyes\nI've got to say \"war\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat until the basic human rights\nAre equally guaranteed to all\nWithout regard to race\nThen we say \"war\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nThat until that day the dream of lasting peace\nWorld-citizenship and the rule of\nInternational morality will remain\nJust a fleeting illusion to be pursued\nBut never obtained\nAnd everywhere is war\nYou might also like[Verse 5]\nWar in the east\nWar in the west\nWar up north\nWar down south\nThere'll be war\nAnd the rumors of war\n\n[Verse 6]\nThat until the ignoble and unhappy regime\nWhich holds our sisters in Africa, yeah\nAfrica, yeah\nSub-human bondage has been toppled\nUtterly destroyed\nEverywhere is war\n\n[Verse 7]\nAnd until that day\nThe African continent\nWill not know peace\nWe Africans will fight - we find it necessary\nAnd we know we shall win\n'Cause we are confident\nIn the victory\nOf good over evil\nGood over evil\nGood over evilEmbed"
