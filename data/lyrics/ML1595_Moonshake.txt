6 ContributorsMoonshake Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why can’t we go away, just speeding out?
You just don’t want to stay where you aim
You can’t depend and stay all night
You can’t often stay all night

[Chorus]
Better say no more
Woh, woh, woh, woh
Let me free no more

[Verse 2]
Why can’t we wait, stay where you haze
You feel the storm, stay where you haze
You’re waiting then to start on out
We can’t depend where we stay where you mind

[Chorus]
Better way no more
Woh, woh, woh, woh
Let me free no more

[Verse 3]
Why can’t we go or stay where you mind?
You can depend when you stay where you mind
Well, then you go and stray away
You just don’t want to stay where you mind
You might also like[Chorus]
Better way no more
Woh, woh, woh, woh
Let me free no more

[Outro]
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more
Let me free no more1Embed
