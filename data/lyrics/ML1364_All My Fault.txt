5 ContributorsAll My Fault Lyrics[Verse 1]
I guess we've had our fun
But it seems our fun is over now
And that's alright
It's all right
Time for me to move along
And after all is said and done
I'll be alright
And it's alright

[Chorus]
Tell me something that's sure to break my heart
Cause everything's my fault
And I know
I deserve to be alone
Cause everything's my fault

[Verse 2]
Here we go again, unsuccessful to make amends
But that's alright
And it's alright
I've tried as hard as I can but I can't seem to understand
Oh, it's alright
And it's alright

[Chorus]
Tell me something that's sure to break my heart
Cause everything's my fault
And I know
I deserve to be alone
Cause everything's my fault

I guess it's over now your honesty has all run out
But that's alright
And it's alright
I just can't seem to see how the hell you can make believe
That it's alright
It's alright

[Chorus]
Tell me something that's sure to break my heart
Cause everything's my fault
And I know
I deserve to be alone
Cause everything's my fault

[Outro]
And everything's my fault
And everything's my fault
And everything's my fault
And everything's my faultEmbed
