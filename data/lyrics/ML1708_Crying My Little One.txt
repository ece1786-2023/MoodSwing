1 ContributorCrying, My Little One Lyrics[Verse]
Are you crying, my little one, footsore and weary?
I must tramp on through the winter night dreary
Fall asleep, pretty baby, warm on my shoulder
When the snow falls on me colder and colder

[Verse]
You are my dearest one, I have no other
Sleep warm and soft in the arms of your mother
Sleep soft, my darling, my trouble and treasure
Dream of pretty things, dream of your pleasureSee Natalie Merchant LiveGet tickets as low as $185You might also likeEmbed
