Bethina)\nMarawa Sports Worldwide (Rewind the tape)\nBenni McCarthy, thank you so much, look forward to seeing you\nRobert Marawa, good speaking to you as always my brother, and you\u2019re my friend, my man, so give me a call when you\u2019re, when you\u2019ve got a minute or so and we keep in touch\nAlright, thank you so much, I'll phone you\n(Sister Bethina)\n\n[Verse 1: AKA]\nOoh ah, fresh out the bed\nNew Jordan 3s, got a spring in my step\nDo my devotion and drop in a X\nHit th\u0435 Off-ramp and go right to the bag\nThis shit is pendulum motion, it swings\nI just sit back and let God do his thing\nTint in my windows so you can't see in\nI clos\u0435 the circle, we out for revenge\nI am a fan of \u2018Piano but I cannot bend over backwards to fit in with trends\nTell me what happened with Mega?\nGo platinum, I\u2019d rather sell nothing, than lie to my fans\nThis ain\u2019t a costume, I zip up and wear\nJesus is closer and the devil is near\nJust got a text that say 150k, 25th of December, I told them \"No way\", uh\nFamily first is the wave\nMTV List only sharpened the blade\nNot even once did they put me first place\nTragedy happened, has tracks under caption\nGave me the idea to put noose on my neck\nThought of my daughter, I had to persist\nLawyers on lawyers, they cost me a fortune\nThey loya\u2019ed, they loya'ed, put price on my head (Huh)\nAnd I mean full disrespect\nDJ's, y\u2019all just stand behind the decks (Huh)\nSacrificed, blood, sweat and tears (Huh)\nToo many treacherous spins (Mhm)\nInfluencers, oh yeah\nThey think they Mega, they Mega\nOkay you got a few dancers, you think you Kamo Mphela\nShit!\nYou might also like[Chorus: AKA]\nComin\u2019 in, comin\u2019 in hot (Hot)\nComin\u2019 in hot kaMbuzi\nYou cannot sit in my spot (Huh, ah yeah)\nYou cannot block this muthi (Sheesh)\nPyramid, pyramid rocks (Ooh)\nI'm comin\u2019up top, Mbuzi\nI'm cut from a different cloth\nMaterial girl don\u2019t sue me\n\n[Post-Chorus: AKA]\nFuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up\nWhenever I win they whisper\nWhenever I slip it\u2019s Christmas\nWhenever I sip it\u2019s Crystal\nGuapin' my lawyer, watchin' for loyo\nOn my Dior, Christian\nLet\u2019s go!\n\n[Verse 2: AKA]\nOh yeah\nOoh ah, I am the best\nRecord and stay up till the AMs\nTweetin' his fans to blow smoke up his ass\nLegacy, Megacy, that\u2019s all that matters\nWe dont give a fuck about the material\nAs long as I got some food in the fridge\nRoof over my head\nThese awards are just some glorified pieces of metal\nWhat the fuck did it ever do for me\nBesides give me more stress than you ever imagined?\nEverything I thought was bigger than me was revealed to be cap\nThis a new era, Hansie Cronje\nCame face-to-face with the devil and national treasure protea\nI hit that bullshit for six, it's a test\nAll that I ever wanted was money for retros\nNow everytime that I spit it's a swish\nKick coulda told you I'm cool as my wrist\nKept our composure, you thought we was dead?\n150k, that don\u2019t include the Jet\nNostra my Nosa, that's after Gemelli\nI came for the jam or the eggs, Benedict\nThali Gianni, if you smoke for the sec\nThat bubbly so strong, watch out for the steps\nGo!\n[Chorus: AKA]\nComin\u2019 in, comin\u2019 in hot (Yo)\nComin\u2019 in hot kaMbuzi\nYou cannot sit in my spot (No-no)\nYou cannot block this muthi\nPyramid, pyramid rocks\nI'm comin\u2019up top, Mbuzi\nI'm cut from a different cloth, material girl don\u2019t sue me\n\n[Post-Chorus: AKA]\nFuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up\nWhenever I win they whisper\nWhenever I slip it\u2019s Christmas\nWhenever I sip it\u2019s Crystal\nGuapin' my lawyer, watchin' for loyo\nOn my Dior, it's Christian\nLet\u2019s go, yeah!\n\n[Verse 3: Thato Saul]\nYeah\nAse thapelo fela ke tlatsa
