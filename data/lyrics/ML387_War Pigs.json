 "lyrics": "8 ContributorsWar Pigs LyricsGenerals gathered in their masses\nJust like witches at black masses\nEvil minds that plot destruction\nSorcerer of death's construction\nIn the fields the bodies burning\nAs the war machine keeps turning\nDeath and hatred to mankind\nPoisoning their brainwashed minds\nOh Lord Yeah!\n\nPoliticians hide themselves away\nThey only started the war\nWhy should they go out to fight?\nThey leave peril to the poor, yeah\n\nTime will tell on their empower minds\nMaking war just for fun\nTreating people just like pawns in chess\nWait 'til their judgment day comes, yeah\n\nNow in darkness world stops turning\nAs you hear the bodies burning\nNo more War Pigs have the power\nHand of God has struck the hour\nDay of judgment, God is calling\nOn their knees the War Pigs crawling\nBegging mercies for their sins\nSatan, laughing, spreads his wings\nOh Lord Yeah!You might also likeEmbed"
