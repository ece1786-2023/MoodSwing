6 ContributorsEverything I Miss At Home Lyrics[Intro: Cherrelle]
Oh, me
I never meant for this to happen (Ooh)
But if it's wrong, I just feel so right

[Chorus: Cherrelle]
You give me attention
You're someone who understands my needs
A man who is sensitive
Everything I miss at home
You know how to hold me
And do all the things I want to feel
Inside of each tender kiss
I get everything I miss at home

[Verse 1: Cherrelle]
I was just out on the town, in search of some fun
I wasn't looking for love
Then you came along and shared with me
All the things I miss at home

[Chorus: Cherrelle]
You give me attention (Mmm)
You're someone who understands my needs
A man who is sensitive (Ooh)
Everything I miss at home
You know how to hold me (Ooh, hold me)
And do all the things I want to feel (Feel)
Inside of each tender kiss (Oh)
I get everything I miss at home
You might also like[Verse 2: Cherrelle]
Oh yes, I do love someone
But I can't pretend to be the happy one (The happy one)
And be taking for granted
I was lonely (So lonely)
(I'm not meant to be lonely) But you were there for me

[Chorus: Cherrelle & Alexander O'Neal]
You give me attention
You're someone who understands my needs (Girl, I understand your needs)
A man who is sensitive (Oh yeah, yeah)
Everything I miss at home (Oh, baby)
You know how to hold me (Hold, I know how to hold you, baby)
And do all the things I want to feel (I wanna feel you, girl)
Inside of each tender kiss (Oh)
I get everything I miss at home (Oh)

[Outro: Cherrelle & Alexander O'Neal]
Home is where the heart is, baby
(Things I miss at home) And I'm at home
Home is where you let your feelings show
(Things I miss at home) Everything that I know
'Til I met you, I felt all alone (Things I miss at)
Now you've given me everything I miss at home
You're at home, baby (You give me attention)
(Things I miss at home) And you don't have to go nowhere, girl
When you hold me tight (Things I miss at home)
You're so close to me, oh, you're right
You're giving me everything I miss at homeEmbed
