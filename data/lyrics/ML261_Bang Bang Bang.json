Take get out the door\nDice symbolise my life, roll 'em on the floor\nFrom your grubby hands as you ham and grandstand\nYou live a shitty life, we live the bon bon vie\nYou hide it in the book while we watch the TV\nThink you got us fooled? Who? Never again\nFirst time, shame on me, second time, your time will end\n\n[Chorus: MNDR]\nNo way, bang, you're dead, paint your silhouette\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate (Oh no, oh no, oh no)\nBang, you're dead, alouette, paint your silhouette\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate (Oh no, oh no, oh no)\nYou might also like[Post-Chorus: MNDR]\nNo way, no, the clock is ticking forward\nNo way, it's just a cruel, cruel world\n\n[Verse 3: Q-Tip]\nCruel world is fittin', they got us all hidden\nWith late night divisions and lab rat incisions\nBut faced with decisions to fight or fricasse\nAnd you clearly decided on how to handle me\nDifficile, imbecile, is it fake? Is it real?\nAre we dyin' on our feet? Are we tryin' in our sleep?\nThere's a rumor goin' 'round 'bout the suits runnin' town\nIf you look into the sky, dead birds fly high, high, high\n\n[Verse 4: MNDR]\nNumbers, you fly by numbers\nYou're logging hours and don't see the big picture\nOver your shoulder, you'll get no last words\nBecause it's too late, you've clipped your own wings\n(Your own wings)\n\n[Chorus: MNDR]\nNo way, bang, you're dead, paint your silhouette\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate (Oh no, oh no, oh no)\nBang, you're dead, alouette, paint your silhouette\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate (Oh no, oh no, oh no)\n[Bridge: Q-Tip & MNDR]\nWe're never gonna believe in the stories that you're weavin'\n(Oh no, oh no, oh no)\nWe're never gonna believe in the stories that you're weavin'\n(Oh no, oh no, oh no)\nWe're never gonna believe in the stories that you're weavin'\n(Oh no, oh no, oh no)\nWe're believin' in the proof, we're believin' in the truth\nWe're believin' in each other, not you, you, you\n\n[Verse 5: MNDR & Q-Tip]\nStories (You with the tall tales)\nHow many stories? (So many tall tales)\nWe climb the structure (We scale the ladder)\nYou build it higher (You make us madder)\nWe take our aim (So now we're bearin' arms)\nYou perch above your nest (Gotcha in your charms)\nThe stories in your head (Crazy bald-headed)\nThat's what got you dead\n\n[Chorus: MNDR]\nNo way, bang, you're dead, paint your silhouette\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate (Oh no, oh no, oh no)\nBang, you're dead, alouette, paint your silhouette\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate\nJe te plumerai la t\u00eate (Oh no, oh no, oh no)\n[Outro: MNDR]\nUn, deux, trois\nNo one ever does it like that anymore\nBang, bang, bang\nWhen feathers fly, you can deny everything (Alouette)\nUn, deux, trois (Bang, bang)\nNo one ever does it like that anymore\nBang, bang, bang (Alouette)\nWhen feathers fly, you can deny everything, yeah\n(Oh no, oh no, oh no)3Embed"
