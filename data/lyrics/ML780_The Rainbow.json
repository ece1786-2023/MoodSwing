 "lyrics": "1 ContributorThe Rainbow LyricsVerse 1\nThis is a forecast of a storm\nFor some it seems that this storm won't pass\nFor you it seems so dark\nThat day will never ever come into your life\nSunny and bright\n\nChorus\nSo when the rain falls down on me\nLord take me high up so I can see\nThe rainbow, the rainbow\nThough the rain cause many complications\nLord i'm still looking for your decoration\nCalled the rainbow\nI wanna see your rainbow\nThe rainbow tells me this storm has passed\nThe rainbow tells me this storm has passed\n\nVerse 2\nMy god his word it just won't fail\nAnd his glory it will prevail\nJust like the rainbow in the sky\nIt's so powerful and it's so bright\nThe rainbow, I wanna see the rainbow\n\nChorus\nYou might also likeVamp\nHe'll take your winter\nTurn it to spring\nSummer will fall\nFall into place\n\nThe storm has passed, the storm\nThis storm has passed\n\nThe rainbow tells me this storm has passedEmbed"
