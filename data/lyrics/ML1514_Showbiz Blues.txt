Tell me anybody
Now do you really give a damn for me
I said tell me anybody
Do you really give a damn for me

[Chorus 1]
Oh because I just got to tell you
About a thing that's bothering me
I was a rambling pony
I would roll, I would roll
I would roll from town to town
I was a rambling pony
I would roll from town to town

[Bridge]
Yes just looking for a sweet woman
And making my love come on down

[Chorus 2]
If I need anybody
Baby I would take you home with me
If I need anybody
Baby I would take you, Baby I would take you
Baby I would take you home with me
Whoa but I don't need nobody
I don't anybody but him and me

And you're sitting there so green
Believe me man I'm just the same as you
I said you're sitting there so green
Believe me man I'm just the same as you
You want me to make a last cry I'll be satisfied
And that's exactly what I mean to do1Embed
