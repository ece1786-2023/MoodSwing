7 ContributorsDo You Call My Name Lyrics(Kill me with a beat)

[Verse 1]
Some people seem to think
They always know what's best for you
Their little minds try to
Create a world to keep you still
The bolt is thrown, the cage is locked
You saw this, don't you lie
At first you cry and then
You hate those people, stole your will

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
(No nothing)

[Chorus]
Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore
You might also like[Verse 2]
So you just sit there stuck
Afraid to risk reality
Afraid to cause yourself
More pain to face insanity
But nothing ventured, nothing gained
You see your fear's your cage
You beg for help but
You're alone stuck in a helpless rage

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario

[Bridge]
It's me...
I see...
Please...
(Let me out, I'm petrified)
[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
(C'mon)

[Chorus]
Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymoreEmbed
