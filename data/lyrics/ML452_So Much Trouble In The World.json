(give a little) Ye-ah! (give a little)\nYe-ah! (give a little) Yeah!\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo you think you've found the solution\nBut it's just another illusion!\n(So before you check out this tide)\nDon't leave another cornerstone\nStanding there behind, eh-eh-eh-eh!\nWe've got to face the day\n(Ooh) Ooh-wee, come what may\nWe the street people talking\nYeah, we the people struggling\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nNow they sitting on a time bomb; (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)\nNow I know the time has come: (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)\nWhat goes on up is coming on down, (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)\nGoes around and comes around. (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)\n\n[Outro]\nSo much trouble in the world\nSo much trouble in the world\nSo much trouble in the world\nThere is so much trouble (so much trouble in the world)\nThere is so much trouble\nThere is so much trouble (so much in the world)\nThere is so much trouble\nThere is so much trouble in the world (so much trouble in the world)\nThere is (so much in the world)\n(So much trouble in the world)3Embed"
