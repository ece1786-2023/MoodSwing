I hurry to my blue heaven
Turn to the right, a little white light
Will lead me to my blue heaven

I'll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy room
A little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom
Just Jilly and me and baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven

You know I'm gonna see a smiling face, fireplace, a cozy room
A little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom
Just Jilly and me and little baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heavenSee Harry Connick, Jr. LiveGet tickets as low as $89You might also likeEmbed
