(Oh-oh, oh)\nMaybe 'cause you're all I'm living for (Oh-oh, oh)\nWith every heartbeat, I want you madly (Oh-oh, oh)\nIt's in my blood to always love you more, love you more\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh my love, again (Oh-oh)\nWhat I say is true (Oh-oh)\nThough it may sound plain (Oh-oh)\nI love you\nYou might also like[Outro]\nAnd it means more to me than life can offer (Oh-oh, oh)\nAnd if this isn't true love, then, I am sure (Oh-oh, oh)\nThat after this love, there'll be no other (Oh-oh, oh)\nUntil the razor cutsEmbed"
