I couldn't go on\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nBut if you insist on knowing my bliss\nI'll tell you this\nIf you want to know what the reason is\nI only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause your kiss, your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss, your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss is on my list of the best things in life\nBecause your kiss, your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss, your kiss I can't resist\nBecause your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light\n\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nI really miss you, babe\nAhh\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause your kiss, your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss, your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss is on my list of the best things in life\nOh, babe, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss, your kiss I can't resist\nBecause your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light\n[Outro]\nBecause your kiss, your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss, your kiss I can't resist\nBecause your kiss is on my list of the best things in life\nOh-ooh, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss, your kiss I can't resist5Embed"
