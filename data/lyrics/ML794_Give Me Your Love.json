 "lyrics": "1 ContributorTalamasca LyricsFrom that crazy night\nI never forget my love\nBefore he pile of logs\nShe stood like unconscious ghost\nA last scream from the stake\nHer mother was burnt, she heard\nThe crowd...\n\nI took her far away, over the seas\nFar from the fears I thought\nBut the demon followed\nLover of the witches and their souls\n\nAnd now I had to see her there\nOn the place she's always feared\nThe flames waited for her blood\n'Cause of her demon's fault...\n\n\"I've never hurt you, I've never been\nThe witch you want to burn\nThe witch you kill!\nOh, Lasher come\nShow me your love\nGive me a vengence,a great last fight\nShow me your power\nTo show them mine\nDestroy these liars, my untrue sons\nThe killer crowd...\"\nAnd the storm came, the wind blew blood\nWalls fell down on human's flood\nSouls got burnt in the flashes of anger\nMy witch stepped in the tower of the temple\nYou might also likeThrough her eyes, a world of sorrow\nTold me a\nTale of fears and horror\nIn their hearts, she saw all lies:\nHer suffer made the demon awake...\n\nI saw her falling, I saw her blood\nFlowing out of her scarlet mouth\nThe storm stopped, the priests stood up\nTo take her body on the fameing logsEmbed"
