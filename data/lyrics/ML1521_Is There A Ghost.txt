I could sleep, I could sleep
When I lived alone
Is there a ghost in my house?

I could sleep, I could sleep
I could sleep, I could sleep
When I lived alone
Is there a ghost in my house?
When I lived alone
Is there a ghost in my house?
My house

I could sleep, I could sleep
I could sleep, I could sleep
When I lived alone
Is there a ghost in my house?
When I lived alone
Is there a ghost in my house?
My house

I could sleep, I could sleep
I could sleep, I could sleep
When I lived alone
Is there a ghost in my house?
When I lived alone
Is there a ghost in my house?
