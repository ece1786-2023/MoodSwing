Can't find the answers
I've been crawlin' on my knees
Lookin' for anything
To keep me from drowning

[Verse 2]
Promises have been turned to lies
Can't even be honest inside
Now I'm runnin' backwards
Watchin' my life wave me goodbye

[Chorus]
I'm runnin' blind
I'm runnin' blind
Somebody help me see
I'm runnin' blind

[Verse 3]
Searchin' for nothing
Wonderin' if I'll change
I'm tryin' everything
But everything still stays the same

[Verse 4]
I thought if I showed you I could fly
Wouldn't need anyone by my side
I'm goin' backwards
With broken wings I know I'll die
You might also like[Chorus]
Runnin' blind
Runnin' blind
Somebody help me see
I'm runnin' blind
Runnin' blind
Runnin' blind
I'm runnin' blind

[Verse 1]
I can't find the answers
I've been crawlin' on my knees
Looking for anything
To keep me from drowning

[Outro]
I'm runnin' blind
I'm runnin' blind
Runnin' blind
I'm runnin' blind
Runnin' blind
I'm runnin' blind
Runnin' blind
I'm runnin' blind
Runnin' blindEmbed
