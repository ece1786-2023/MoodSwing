Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYankee soldier\nHe wanna shoot some skag\nHe met it in Cambodia\nBut now he can't afford a bag\nYankee dollar talk\nTo the dictator of the world\nIn fact it's giving orders\nAnd they can't afford to miss a word\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so bored with the U.S.A\nI'm so bored with the U.S.A\nBut what can I do?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYankee detectives\nAre always on the TV\nBecause killers in America\nWork seven days a week\nNever mind the stars and stripes\nLet's play the Watergate Tapes\nI'll salute the New Wave\nAnd I hope nobody escapes\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so bored with the U.S.A\nI'm so bored with the U.S.A\nBut what can I do?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm so bored with the U.S.A\nI'm so bored with the U.S.A\nBut what can I do?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so bored with the U.S.A\nI'm so bored with the U.S.A\nI'm so bored with the U.S.A\nBut what can I do?\n\n[Outro]\nMove up Starsky\nFor the C.I.A\nSuck on Kojak\nFor the U.S.AEmbed"
