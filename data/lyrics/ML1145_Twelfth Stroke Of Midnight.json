 "lyrics": "1 ContributorTwelfth Stroke of Midnight LyricsI can't read between the lines of a letter\nThat you've never written\nI can't begin to compromise\nOn a problem that you have invented\n\nDead stares cut a paper heart\nAnd beats ink in these pages\nLetters written in regret\nTo many lifeless faces\nThis is the end of me\nI am running on empty\n\nHours spent pouring over these words\nWith nothing gained\nAll that was lost with nothing learned\nI'm just feeling drained\n\nThis is taking so much out of me\nI am doubting my place as of late\n\nI wish I could make this paper heart come alive\nAll my time spent on writing this living lie\n\nThis is taking so much out of me\nI am doubting my place as of late\nYou might also likeI wish I could make this paper heart come alive\nAll my time spent on this lieEmbed"
