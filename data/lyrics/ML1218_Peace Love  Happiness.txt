2 ContributorsPeace, Love and Happiness LyricsWhy let this world just wait on your shoulders?
Pick it up, push it off, before you let yourself get colder
Just look into the eyes, the good eyes of a child
And see that love rise like a river and float for a thousand miles

Gimme some
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Alright now
Come on get to me

Breathin' deep, feel your heart beat
Just to know that life's worth living
Feel your feet on the earth
You better love it while it's still here spinning

I got no time to worry
About troubles on been givin'
You gotta let it flow, let yourself go
'Cause if you're hatin, you sure ain't livin'

Gimme some
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Come on give it to me
You might also likeLookee here
Lotta people talking, somebody to listen
Lotta people struggling
If you got some, you better start giving

Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Come on, now
You wanna give it to me
You gotta give it up

I go and eat this daily bread
With so many people starving
How come the presidents just build more bombs
When nations start disarming?

With all that money spent on guns
'Stead of food and education
Need to buy a little peace and love instead
Start the healing of the nation

Gimme some
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Alright now
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Gimme some
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)

Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness)
Peace, love, happiness (peace, love, happiness) YeahEmbed
