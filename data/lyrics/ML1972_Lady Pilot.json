 "lyrics": "9 ContributorsLady Pilot LyricsWhat?\n\nStars can't fight city lights\nThey've turned their backs on us\nIt's true today, I saw it from the plane\nAeroplanes were never built to fly\n\nDown, down, down, down\nDown, down, down, down, down, down\nDon't look down\nDon't look now\n\nCrosshairs of our shadow trace the dam\nTold that there were people trapped alive\nBoulder City looks like coals in the fire\n\nCabin's perched by satellites\nAnd now we're flying blind\nWe've got a lady pilot\nShe's not afraid to die\n\nIt's true today, I saw it from the plane\nWe've almost finished reeling in the sky\nPower lines once laced the heavens\nPima County looks like coals in the fireYou might also likeEmbed"
