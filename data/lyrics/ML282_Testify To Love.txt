All the colors of the rainbow
All the voices of the wind
Every dream that reaches out
That reaches out to find where love begins
Every word of every story
Every star in every sky
Every corner of creation
Lives to testify

[Chorus]
For as long as I shall live
I will testify to love
I'll be a witness in the silences
When words are not enough
With every breath I take
I will give thanks to God above
For as long as I shall live
I will testify to love

[Verse 2]
From the mountains to the valleys
From the rivers to the sea
Every hand that reaches out
Every hand that reaches out to offer peace
(Give peace a chance)
Every simple act of mercy
Every step to kingdom come
All the hope in every heart will
Speak what love has done
You might also like[Chorus]
For as long as I shall live
I will testify to love
I'll be a witness in the silences
When words are not enough
With every breath I take
I will give thanks to God above
For as long as I shall live
I will testify to love

[Bridge]
Colors of the rainbow, voices of the wind
Dream that reaches out where love begins
Word of every story, star in every sky
Corner of creation testify
Mountains to the valleys, rivers to the sea
(Testify, testify)
Hand that reaches out to offer peace
Simple act of mercy, step to kingdom come
(Testify, testify)
Every heart will speak of what love has done
Colors of the rainbow, voices of the wind
(Testify, testify)
Dream that reaches out where love begins
Word of every story, star in every sky
(Testify, testify)
Corner of creation testify
[Chorus]
For as long as I shall live
I will testify to love
I'll be a witness in the silences
When words are not enough
With every breath I take
I will give thanks to God above
For as long as I shall live
I will testify

For as long as I shall live
I will testify to love
I'll be a witness in the silences
When words are not enough
With every breath I take
I will give thanks to God above
For as long as I shall live
I will testify to love

For as long as I shall live
(For as long as I shall live)
I will testify to love
(I'll testify, testify)
I'll be a witness in the silences
(All my life, I'll testify)
When words are not enough
(For as long as I shall live)
With every breath I take
(I'll testify, testify)
I will give thanks to God above
For as long as I shall live
(All my life, I'll testify)
I will testify to love
