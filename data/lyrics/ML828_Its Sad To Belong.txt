5 ContributorsItâ€™s Sad to Belong Lyrics(Verse 1)
Met you on a springtime day
You were minding your life and I was minding mine, too
Lady, when you looked my way
I had a strange sensation and, darling, that's when I knew

(Chorus)
That it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along

(Verse 2)
Oh, I wake up in the night
And I reach beside me hoping you will be there
But instead I find someone
Who believed in me when I said I'd always care

(Chorus)
Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along

(Bridge)
So I lived my life in a dream world
For the rest of my days
Just you and me walking hand in hand
In a wishful memory
You might also likeOh, I guess that's all
That it would ever be

(Verse 3)
Wish I had a time machine
I could make myself go back until the day I was born
And I would live my life again
And rearrange it so that I'd be yours from now on

(Chorus)
Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along

Yes, it's sad to belong to someone elseEmbed
