10 ContributorsShoot Down LyricsShoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang

Shoot the gun
Itâ€™s all inside us
And also know
That I slice us

Too many tied to the
Too many tied to the bang, bang, bang

Shoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang

There's no fun
A sorry face

Shoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang

Too many tied to the
Too many tied to the bang, bang, bang

There's no fun
Sorry face
There's no fun
Sorry fate
