1 ContributorRolling Stones (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You and I
We’re not like them
You ain't got no money
And I’m broke as hell
Lets make the best
Of a couple days
Get into some trouble
Fall on our face

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh gonna hang with with Jack and Molly and
Oh, gonna finish what we started

[Chorus]
Lets be a mess
Never going home
We’ll be remembered like the Rolling Stones
Watch the sun come up
Through a cloud of smoke
We’ll be remembered like the rolling stones

[Verse 2]
Just another night
We’re this far in
Buying drinks for strangers
Just to make some friends
We’ll never see this place again
Lets crash the hotel room
When the feeling ends
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh gonna hang with with Jack and Molly and
Oh, gonna finish what we started

[Chorus]
Lets be a mess
Never going home
We’ll be remembered like the Rolling Stones
Watch the sun come up
Through a cloud of smoke
We’ll be remembered like the rolling stones

[Bridge]
Tonight we live like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
Tonight we live like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
Tonight we live like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

[Chorus]
Lets be a mess
Never going home
We’ll be remembered like the Rolling Stones
Watch the sun come up
Through a cloud of smoke
We’ll live forever like the rolling stones
[Outro]
We'll live forever like the rolling stonesEmbed
