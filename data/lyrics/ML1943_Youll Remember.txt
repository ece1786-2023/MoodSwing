1 ContributorYouâ€™ll Remember LyricsMaybe one day
Along the way
You'll remember me
On this island

Smiling at you
How I used to
Maybe one day
You'll remember

And it won't be sad
To think of all we had
All unhappy ends
Will be behind us then

Maybe one day
Along the way
You'll think of me
And you'll be smiling

Maybe one day
Maybe one day
Maybe one day
