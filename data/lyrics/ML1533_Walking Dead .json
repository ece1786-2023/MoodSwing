(Life after death)\n\n\n[Verse 1]\nIn the chill of the night\nI can feel my heart racing\nAs I run towards the light\nThat seems so far away\nWandering forever\nIn the darkest of shadows\nWondering if I will ever see you again\n\nWondering if I will ever see you again\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll take your love\n(I'll take your love)\nI'll take your hate\n(take your hate)\nI'll take your desire\n\nI'll take the world\nWhen it turns on you\n(when it turns on you)\nI'll set it on fire\nYou might also like[Hook]\nW-the-w-th-th-the walking dead\nThe walking dead (walking dead)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDigging in the dirt\nI can feel you getting closer\nSteadying my hands through the blistering pain\nAnxiously awaiting for the earth to reveal you\nWondering if I will ever see you again (see you again)\n\nWondering if I will ever see you again\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll take your love\n(I'll take your love)\nI'll take your hate\n(take your hate)\nI'll take your desire\n\nI'll take your heart\nI'll take your pain\n(I'll take your pain)\nI'll bring you to life\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI'll bring you to life\n[Hook]\nW-the-w-th-th-the walking dead\nThe walking dead (walking dead)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'll bring you to life\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll take your love\n(I'll take your love)\nI'll take your hate\n(take your hate)\nI'll take your desire\n\nI'll take the world\nWhen it turns on you\n(it turns on you)\n\n[Hook]\nW-the-w-th-th-the walking dead\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll take your love\n(I'll take your love)\nI'll take your hate\n(take your hate)\nI'll take your desire\nI'll take your heart\nI'll take your pain\n(I'll take your pain)\n\nI'll bring you to life!\n\n[Outro]\nThere is no such thing as death\nThere is only change, change, change, changeEmbed"
