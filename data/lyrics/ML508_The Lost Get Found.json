(Why do we play it safe?)\nLove came to show us the way\nLove is a chance we should take\nI'm movin' out of the gray\nDa-da, da-da, da-da\nDa-da, da-da, da-da\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't let your lights go down\nDon't let your fire burn out\n'Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe\n(Stand out)\nDon't let your lights go down\nDon't let your fire burn out (Stand out)\n'Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe\nWhy don't you rise up now?\nDon't be afraid to stand out\nThat's how the lost get found\nThe lost get found\n[Outro]\nSo when you get the chance\nAre you gonna take it?\nThere's a really big world at your fingertips\nAnd you know you have the chance to change it1Embed"
