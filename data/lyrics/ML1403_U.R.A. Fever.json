Fever Lyrics[Verse 1: Jamie Hince, Alison Mosshart]\nWalk you to the counter\nWhat you got to offer\nPick you out a soda\nLook at you forever\nWalk you to the water\nEyes like a casino\nYou ain't born typical\nFind a piece of silver\nPretty as a diagram\nGo down to the Rio\nPut it in my left hand\nPut it in a fruit machine\nEveryone's a winner\nLaughing like a seagull\n\n[Chorus: both]\nYou are a fever, you are a fever\nYou ain't born typical\nYou are a fever, you are a fever\nYou ain't born typical\n\n[Verse 2:Jamie Hince, Alison Mosshart & both]\nLiving in a suitcase\nMeet a clown and fall in love\nBeen dying to have you over\nClown around and break up\nTake you to a jukebox\nThat's the situation\nPick you out a number\nThat's our arrangement\nSee The Kills LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also likeDancing on the legs of a new born pony\nLeft right left right, keep it up son\nGo ahead and have her, go ahead and leave her\nYou only ever had her when you were a fever\n\n[Chorus: both]\nI am a fever, I am a fever\nI ain't born typical\nI am a fever, I am a fever\nI ain't born typical\n\nWe are a fever, We are a fever\nWe ain't born typical\nWe are a fever, We are a fever\nWe ain't born typical\nWe are a fever, We are a fever\nWe ain't born typical\nWe are a fever, We are a fever\nWe ain't born typical1Embed"
