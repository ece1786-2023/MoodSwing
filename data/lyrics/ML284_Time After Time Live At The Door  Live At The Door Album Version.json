Look what I got, look what I bought\nCamera is my true eye, I'm a side-clause\nShoes, they go too high, only high-tops\nFuck yeah, I'm the new guy, what am I on?\nCome in, Jaden Smith, I'm a motherfuckin' icon\nBoy, I'm too cold, I don't even have on my ice on\nToo lit, I don't even have the mic on\nAnd I'm too bright, I don't even have the lights on\nBetter wait up\nShit's too easy, like a layup\nAnd my bitch too entertainin'\nSee the note, you gotta stay up\nTakin' bets on that I'll fail\nIt's time to pay up\nNow you tryna hide your face\nI'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh\nI'm droppin' hits and gettin' world records\nWho's your favorite artist, 'cause I'm sure better?\nWell, maybe not, but I tried, though\nPost Malone, I go psycho\nLeave you a stink, like a rhino\n'Cause I rap beef, no gyro\nAnd I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow\nTurned my L's into W's; typo\nUh, hop into the track\nGive you the love and you give it right back\nTen different flows I be spittin', some trap\nAnd some other shit get in it's get on the map\nDone this for like a year, and now, my writing's clear\nI've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here\nAnd I'm here to stay, did you hear me say\n\"I'm not here to play\"?\n\"He got a flow and a voice now\nI remember when he chokin' a boy out\nBut he's back in, showin' no choice now\nDon't you know that he's gonna destroy now?\"\nSo I'm gonna get there, and I know how\nGot these beats, I be blarin' 'em so loud\nWhen we talk about bitches and money, this shit is so funny\nMy parents are so proud, damn\nI'm startin' to try\nTryin' the shots at it, look at the ground and see stars in the sky\nDrawin' the line\nAll of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes\nYou're probably high\nIf you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines\nCopyin' guys\nYou better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly\nThirty-thousand words on a track, lil' bitch\nNow these people turn my vid on and react, lil' bitch\nKnow I got the clout, I got the stats, lil' bitch\nAnd you givin' me a headache, where's the Advil, bitch?\nBut I'm doin' all I can, and I did it in the past-tense\nMakin' all this money up off of YouTube, off me AdSense\nMoney up off of YouTube, off AdSense\nAll of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then\nAnd I rap, huh, I'm a laptop\nEminem holds the world record for \"Rap God\"\n1.6K words\nThough, we already have that topped\nAnd we'll do it for another hour\nAnd I'm underrated and I'm underpowered\nMy bars are so filthy, uh\nAll of y'all need to take another shower\nFor every fan, there's a hundred doubters\nAnd they let me know up in the comments\nBut you know that we ain't done\n'Cause I gotta talk my nonsense\nAnd I gotta keep it clean, uh\nDo exactly what my mom says\nAnd I know when they headed for the top\nAnd we still be makin' progress\nI can spit bars for nine months\nThen deliver you a new life\nYeah, we eatin' in this bitch, uh\nAll y'all better take a huge bite\nAnd I didn't even write that shit\n'Cause I freestyle, you still like that shit\nSee my video, press 'like' on it\nThat subscribe button? Better wipe that shit\nI'm getting tired of this beat\nI think it's time to change it\n'Cause I'll spaz on trap\nOld school boom-bap, you name it\nThink of that as a intro\nNow we get into the meat of it\nThis some shit you didn't see comin'\nI don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!\nYou might also like[Part II]\n\n[Intro 2]\nHeh, ayy!\nAyy, ayy\nUh, switch up\nYeah, ayy, ayy, ayy\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook out the window, see past it, but we're faintin' reflections\nYou never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions\nYou headin' down the wrong path and they changin' directions\nMaybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessin'\nAnd lately, I question the shit that was taught to me\nI'm awkwardly stoppin' these conversations\nHey, how long you waitin' till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?\nI don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs, but you still gotta play it\nDon't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it\nStop contemplatin' and stop complainin'\nAnd recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative\nReached the place where you still vibe in that shit when we replay it\nLiving a life of pain just to alleviate it\nWhen you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it\nYeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it\nWe headin' onto new platforms and leavin' the basics\n[Verse 3]\nUh, my creative process is making progress\nDespite my background, I haven't gotten to playin' lacrosse yet\nDon't you know we got a good thing goin'?\nI've been watchin' all these shows while I could be showin'\nI've been creeping up on the door, so dangerous\nYou looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changin' them\nI done learned so many things in my past life\nNow I don't give a single shit about the rap life\nThat's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it\nHave twice much the fame, and\nI can't even comprehend that much in the future\nHatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor\nEnter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder\nStealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter\nProcrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer\nNo willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser\n\n[Verse 4]\nSittin' alone at 3 AM\nChillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend\nMan, this shit is too wild, I \"must behave, Ben\"\nThat's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when\nI'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence\nAccomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?\n-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me\nLuckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me\nI hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it\nI hope that one day, you'll see we made it\nNo, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it\nI'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest\nThat is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'\nI'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'\nI'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside\nGuessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind\n[Hook 1]\nAnd I'm in time\n-Workin' all my life, get that in line\nI'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out\nNobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline\nI'm on the incline, I'm on the incline\nStay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine\nI'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline\nNobody can really understand how my shit climb\n\n[Verse 5]\nHave I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet\nI'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead\nI stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous\nWho is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?\nWhy the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do\nI don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, \"Bye\", to you\nHey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do\nYou have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue\nYou gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset\nSet headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead\nI guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed\nImpressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said\nBut I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song\nDo right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron\nYou try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes\nSome straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline\n\n[Interlude 1]\nWater break\nI got a lot to say\nIt's been eleven minutes so far\nActually, it hasn't, it's been shorter\n\n[Verse 6]\nHow can\nI have a believable meaning\nWhen all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury\nNobody seen it or  greet it?\nBut what if it's different? I mean, it's all seeming to be\nAnd it's in inconceivable dreaming\nI know it's so unbelievable, being\nStuck in this rare unachievable feeling\nThey givin' me something, I ended up leaving\nThey givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'\nNo positive side, ended up seeing\nWhat life could be like from a  different lead in\nThank God for a cover zone\nSo I know when and where to cross it\nAll over the place\nI'm surprised I haven't lost it\n\n[Hook 2]\nYeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh\nLivin' to the max now\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down\nGo till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out\nAfter, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out\nBut I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout\n\n[Verse 7]\nOkay, it's time to go fast\nSo sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it\nAbout time, but maybe you're mad I said it\nYou gon' pay attention, cash or credit?\nI have to let it go back a second\nI have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit\nNow we're back in the middle of the track and fed it\nMix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it\nWe moved on, walked past the exit\nWant you to come back and pass a message\n-Never pack bags and trash, you left it\nKinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it\nMoney, never am glad I spent it\nIf I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it\nIf you ever feel bad or sad, accept it\nThink back to the track and the rap that Ben did\nYeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it\nIf this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus\nI'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this\nVoice is more powerful than a million instruments\nSuddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else\nPeople want me to grow because of you\nBut I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better\nThan the people that never had trust in me\nYeah, uh\n\n[Hook 3]\nAnd I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah\nLivin' to the max now, uh\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds\n\n[Verse 8]\nSpeak up, and they're messing with the track now\nPeople are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short\nLooking back at you when you're missing all the cash now\nAnd I'm mad at the fact that\nI'm not in my right mind\nMeant to be a half-decent rapper\nBut I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time\nLookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find\nLookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime\nI find so much life\nI wonder why I can't just find mine\nGot so many confusing questions\nSo much knowledge, I can't use the lessons\nI'm emerging out with a new profession\nI'ma do the best with my new perfection\nAnd I'm doin' it\nI'm moving onto this future shit\nThese hooligans are complete fools in that\nThey just don't understand that I am through with it\nImprovin' it, I'm improvin' it\nI got my brain, and I'm usin' it\nAnd I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin'\nAnd makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits\nYou're clueless\nNinety percent of y'all ignorant\nKeeping your minds oh-so limited\nGet off your high horse, because it is time to figure it out\nSeeming so close, I can picture it now\nSuccess in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now\nEnvisioning deeper ambitions, and now\nI'ma get to it, that is what living's about\n\n[Interlude 2]\nUh, God!\nUh\nMy voice is gone already, shit\nAlright, ayy, ayy, ayy\n\n[Verse 9]\nThink I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches\nAdolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us\nMakin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die\nMakin' you hang your head low, but say, \"Reach for the skies\"\nLife is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies\nI'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes\nI feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry\nWith all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try\nYeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply\nTryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry\nFuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, \"Why?\"\nSo I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh\nLike, oh well, I can say that I tried\nHopped into life and then I stayed for the ride\nSo many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside\nAnd I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn\nThis reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.\u200b\nI'm screamin', \"Hi\" to the sky up with a smile on my face\nNow I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace\nAll of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place\nSwept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace\nAnd now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet\nI used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic\nRecently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it\nSee my friends from kindergarten go to rehab\nThat's the type of shit that makes you think back\nTo simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds\nBefore reality could ground us, we would live in the skies\nAnd as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)\nMan, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist\nI felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist\nAnd now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit\nYou only look at what you got once you see that it's lost\nAnd life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce\nDon't understand rappers braggin', \"I got that paper on me\"\nMan, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me\nSo what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?\nTo me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money\nRain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study\nAnd write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn\nLike Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize\nThese Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's\nThis is a natural high\nI see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies\nI wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried\nThey say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie\nThey think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid\nAs DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive\nThrew out half of my album, it wasn't good enough\nShit, I mean it still isn't good enough\nI'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt\nBut I guess I am not full enough, damn\nI swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel\nMan, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal\nMan, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real\nThirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel\nYeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement\nYeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent\nEvery day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest\nAnd if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted\nMost of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me\nSo when I die, I know I left us with something to leave\nSo when I wake up in the morning with something to see\nYeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be\n\n[Verse 10]\nBenny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said\nIf you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-\nMany want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant\nGot iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence\nYeah, I know I'm way too cocky\nBut I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out\nSo when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better\nThat's benefit of the doubt\nI've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom\nIt's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often\nAnd I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around\nAlways stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-\nYeah, this is freedom of speech\nTryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace\nSacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree\nOpportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-\nNah, I'm just tryna find some clarity\nApparently, it all has to do with popularity\nThere will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to\nWhat is carefully being prepared to me\nSometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity\nI'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least\n\n[Verse 11]\nGiving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see\nEveryone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy\n'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case\nShot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass\nOff of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say\nAnd at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say\nSo let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages\nSeeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand\nThat I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest\nEntertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in\n\n[Verse 12]\n-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize\nStart an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try\nThat's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'\nWith the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon\nBut I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'\nLimited ability with little humility\nBut whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me\nI'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history\nTryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me\nTryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg\nYou beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me\nShowin' up on your device, control/option/delete\nConsider myself elite, measure myself in retweets\nI be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me\nInstead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout\nI'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house\nTryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch\nI'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out\nInto reality, in normality actually happily\nFound myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?\n'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing\nNothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing\nNot complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it\nLove sleepin' and just usin' the internet\nBut my time is limited, and I better figure this\nBefore I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips\nAnd let me just tell you what I have came to do\nTryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to\nTryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo\nAnd say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through\nAnd if a major record label is looking at me\nI'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats\nI can rap fast, and rap slow\nI may make mistakes but everyone, has, so\nI'm like MJ back when he had the afro\nAlso, I'm not black, so... maybe not\nBut before everyone gets angry, stop\nI'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block\nAll the people who keep on going crazy off\n'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got\nA lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker\nWith some dominant teachers\nI deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers\nI'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager\nThey be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it\nTo know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid\nSo when you're nearin' this, please let me know\nWhen I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go\nHear the metronome combined in the compilation\nTo unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation\nBut that is just a dream, and probably a combination\nOf a big ego and false encouragement on the way in\nBut when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game\nI was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name\nBut when you think about it, it is all insane\nWhat can be created from chemicals in this brain\nBut when you look at me, you lackin' respect\nWhen I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest\nHas in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step\nUntil I'm on the same stage, and you have it again\nBut, but when you think about the hall-of-fame\nYou think about how people used to sit and call you names\nAnd you check and wonder if it will be all the same\nStep back into reality, it all remains, damn\n\n[Interlude 3]\nAlright, I just spilled water on my computer right now\nOn my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit\nHold on, uh\nGoddamn it\n\n[Verse 13]\nMy lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean\nThis is off the top, I don't need to use no machines\nHold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever\nBut I am very clever, okay, okay\nI'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too\nThese are some shit' that you can drink to\nBut drink water unless you're of age\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Ayy\n\n[Interlude 4]\nOkay, okay\nUh\nUh\nAyy\n\n[Verse 14]\nI feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous\n-Most of humanity's made of idiots\nI barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?\nYou think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?\nPlease... what I do is barely poetry\nThere's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me\nBut still consider me confident\nStill consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness\nBut honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably\nIt is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling\nInto awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'\nIt's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening\nIt's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake\nI close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away\nYeah, we're just tryna find that great escape\nTo get away from how we're living life day-to-day\nSome people find it in a drink or in a cup\nOr in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love\nBut all I know is that it's tough\nAnd all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much\n\n[Verse 15]\nI'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?\nThese kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players\nThat shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low\nGot amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show\nWhat I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype\nAnd I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life\n-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights\nAhead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night\n-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass\n-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast\nRemember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it\nAnd say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected\nTake a deep breath, 'cause I need that\nMost of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast\nMy bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors\nYou want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards\nSay that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this\nI'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit\nTryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day\n'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?\nI'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go\nI'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own\nI'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit\nReason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch\nMeaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it\nPleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it\nFlow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break\nWe all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day\n'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it\nYou know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments\nAll of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em\nStart a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it\nBreaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it\nI know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'\nUnder the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'\nI found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it\nI try to go slow, but it don't work\n-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure\nYou're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners\nThis is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre\nHah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough\nForgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up\nMy chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us\nAnd so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up\n-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back\nRemember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that\nHit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming\nListen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding\nWe run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through\nThese lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true\n'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred\nShoutout to Didac and Momo and the others\nShit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family\nShoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me\nYeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh\nBetter trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack\nStarted off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me\nIn the past, I never anticipated what there would be\nAnd see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now\nSee ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now\n\n[Interlude 5]\nIt's on now\nOh shit, I'm almost out of water\nThis is a hard- this a- real challenge\nThis like, physically difficult, ayy\n\n[Hook 4]\nWhen I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra\nNow everybody telling me I don't perform enough\nMy math teacher told me that I'd never be shit\nAnd now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula\nI got the formula, I got the formula\nYou got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy\nPeople always asking Ben, \"Why you record so much?\"\nI got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up\n\n[Verse 16]\nFormula, like I'm Mr. Krabs\nI change and transform it up, you stuck in the past\nYeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab\nUh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag\nAnd now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'\nPeople love to criticize me for the life I've had\nThey make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'\nI make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy\nUh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie\nAnd I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami\nWanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'\nTryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies\nAyy, still saying, \"Who would'a thought?\", like, who would'a guessed it?\nHaven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing\nIf you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:\nWant the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook\n\n[Verse 17]\nAyy, they doubt a fucker with a dream\nLooking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah\nLooking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens\nSerpent's told you, \"No,\" and it's like nothing's as it seems\nGod damn, I guess I really thought he was the man\nI guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham\nAll that cash he stocked was from a scam\nAll the views he got was from some spam\nI've been living like, \"Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?\nWhy ain't he just sticking to the plan?\nHow has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?\"\nI don't get it, I don't really understand\nI've been living like, \"Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram\nI'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand\nNext to all these average fucking sad duds?\"\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\n\n[Hook 5]\nYeah\nHate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\nAyy\nJust because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup\nUh, uh, uh\nFeel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones\nAnd so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he\n\n[Verse 18]\n'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine\nI've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap\nThat shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now\nI'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out\nHow did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday\nAnd I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away\nBut I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one\n\n[Verse 19]\nBy now, if you're still watching this shit\nYou are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit\nBut we ain't over, we ain't done, though\nAm I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?\nWell, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K\nWhile all you sit around, I would rather work than play\nLyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae\nHit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates\n\n[Interlude 6]\nThat was actually a pretty good bar\nI just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this\nAyy, ayy\nYou know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh\n\n[Hook 6]\nSometimes, I don't know what to think\nSometimes, I don't know what'll\nMake it okay, make it okay\nI'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy\n\n[Verse 20]\nUh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering\nAll these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen\nAll accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence\nOften is the result of falling under consciousness\nYou'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives\nYou're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie\nAnd I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty\nFearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me\nNo, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever\nBut in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better\nBut I don't ever\nWant to go to show, just one mo' letter\nI'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades\nAnd get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid\nUh... my life is so unusual\nTo most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable\nCan't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral\nI'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero\nUh, but you know that I'm capable\nYou know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available\nFeeling so unique and I think it's not explainable\nNo one hears my lyrics, and says, \"OMG, relatable!\"\nNo, that's not what I'm here to give\nBeen waiting years for this, you're about to experience\nSomething that I've spent time, money and thought on\nLearned about all the times money had thought wrong\nKinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long\nI ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot\n-Out on the inside, see me on the outside\nAlways think I'm positive, and never see the downsides\nIt's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it\nGet your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it\n\n[Interlude 7]\nOkay\nOkay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in\nThirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro\nFuck\n\n[Verse 21]\nYeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware\nI'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared\nI'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs\nBut y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared\nI got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it\nShoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip\nMan, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders\nIt's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip\nDamn, I got a crazy ass work ethic\nBlocked out south east and west, leave in one direction\nI finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it\nFuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection\nWe all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons\nLike a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'\nWanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly\nAnd I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar\nCan't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'\nYeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person\nI base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-\n-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain\n\n[Verse 22]\nYou keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high\nWanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy\nCan't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize\nHow it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize\nAnd analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed\nAnd take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise\nAmerica is very nice, but I'd like to see the world\nBut I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl\n\n[Verse 23]\nIn a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends\nCrazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens\nThey be tens or more, they be tens or more\nI like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors\nIt's free speech, I can say what I want\nBut these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk\nThey don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter\nI get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh\nMotherfucker, I'ma live for the right time\nFuck that, I'ma live for the moment\nSitting here in the middle of the night time\nMy mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'\nDamn, I've been livin' in a headache\nBitches never listenin', they saying that they ready\nBut I can never believe them\nGot these goals and they can never achieve 'em\nHow can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?\nDamn, that's a lot of shit to think about\nSuddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering\nWhat I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out\nMade some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh\nGot these dreams that I'm livin' out\nIn my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses\nThat I never pictured, wow, damn, damn\nThis beat's way too holy to rap over\nMental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower\nYour raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance\nLike a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'\nOoh, but I have got somethin' to tell you\nI ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you\nSpeakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life\nWatching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might\nBe on that stage right beside all these players\nShit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers\nI'll prove it in music I use to influence\nI do this way harder than people assumin'\nResumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'\nThat puts me to be in the view of the hidin'\nI do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me\nNo matter what I do, they just mistake the\nReason I'm flowin', the reason I start up\nNot just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks\nAnd- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place\nMost to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste\nI'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh\nI just need a home run, I already loaded bases\nI have got so many cases\nBeen visiting, living in so many places\nExperiences that I made me to Emmy\nBen, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me\nBe me, I ain't greedy or needy\nBelieve me, I just want to be on your TV\nGet on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase\nDamn, yeah, I've been looking at their space\nAnd, one day, I'll be there\nI know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared\n\n[Verse 24]\nI've been waiting like thirty-thousand years\nTryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear\nI'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career\nI'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here\nNow I earned it, and I'm here to stay\nI'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play\nNot even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame\nNot really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day\nI don't know- I look at the future nostalgically\nI'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me\nUndoubtably know how to be what I am about to be\nTo say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me\n\n[Verse 25]\nRecently, I have been feeling alienated\nMy songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em\nBut, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different\nHate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it\n\n[Verse 26]\nPeople say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen\nAll will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene\nY'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty\nPromise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?\nTrapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages\nWhen I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and\nI'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song\nMove along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns\nWho could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?\nOne great tongue, I am that one great one\nOn vacation, I vacate to a location\nFar away from where people just may run\nA light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun\nOh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young\nI can murder this beat with no gun, go run\nI've too many problems to handle, here, hold one\nI just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks\nAnd now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk\nWas a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station\nPlaying it, making it just get to the worst\nMy head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure\nI'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth\nAnd now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it\nNow the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah\n\n[Verse 27]\nGood rappers never get to see the light of day\nBut when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away\nI'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?\nI'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business\nNobody witness anything better than when I am showing you this shit\nKnow I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, \"Oh, this kid is big\"\nKnow how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen\nTill I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah\nAnd when I'm, uh... I'm telling y'all that I got a story\nGod ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory\nNot visually, typically, the original me\nSo unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally\nDamn, that was fast, felt so jammed till I unpacked\nAnd I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track\nAnd I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real\nWhenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel\nSo different, and I'm loving it, time to change and discover it\nTime to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it\nI always talk to them other kids, them other kids couldn't understand me\nOne path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B\n\n[Interlude 9]\nI wrote that one a long time ago\nThat was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again\nBut you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty\nI- actually... classic!\n\n[Verse 28]\nWe just living in the solar system\nOne big world here to hold the wisdom\nOne big jail to control the victims\nWe're all here, tryna find a soul in rhythm\nA voice in writing and a choice deciding\nWhether or not to follow what the boys are likin'\nWhat the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to\nThink about who you are, and it's so true\nThink about the people who you think have really known you\nDo they really know you? Do you even know you?\nDamn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet\nSometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be\nAnd lately, it seems to make the extremes\nSo prominent and dominant in making big dreams\nI'm seeing aliens scream\nWhen I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing\nBut I'm just tryna make it in life\nFuck you to people who be saying it like\nI ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike\nI'm chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite\nThe fact that I'm young and little bit nerdy\nAnd I know a lot of people would consider me early\nI'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches\nTryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens\nI'm just me, no, I ain't a victim to hurting\nI just see all the people living and burning\nSo be free, time to be a little bit nervous\nIt don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing\nAnd I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it\nGuessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid\nSo I'll see ya 'round, underachievers\nHop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man\n\n[Hook 8]\nSo basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me\nI'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z\nAnd, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three\nBut now, what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?\n\n[Verse 29]\nI've been see' 'ple- misusing their fans, like crooks\nManipulating their audience to catch that hook\nThey'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-\nYou can feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha\nBut no shots fired, though\nNothing wrong with a little bit of lying though\nI mean... look at Fox News\nThat's the whole premise of their entire show\nBut no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist\nMakin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits\nI got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch\nBut I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids\nI got time! Maybe a little too much of it\nBut you know that I'm tryna move up a bit\nPeople look at me and say my potential has\nGot a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it\nSo fire, can't handle me with oven mitts\nUnderground, blessed if you discovered it\nFlow is so unique, I got so much to do\nNot like any other kid\n\n[Hook 9]\nAyy, yo, what you say, though?\nYeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though\nYeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low\nYou know I'm comin' to them checks like Usain Bolt\n\n[Verse 30]\nWait so, inhale the fumes while I paint this\nPicture: me, I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious\nTryna make my moves while they huge and they famous\nI knew this shit I couldn't do, I was jaded\nNow, somehow, I'm next up, yeah, I'm blessed up\nNow I wake up and I'm fly, I don't dress up\nNow I'm fly and my opponents better catch up\nI get my checks, uh, all y'all need to step up\nI-I-I-I-I-I- remember tryna practice my cadence\nIn tracks I was makin', I had to be patient\nEverybody said that shit was trash, and they were right\nBut I turned that shit and made a right, shit is day and night\nNow I gotta take a flight to Vegas, might not stay the night\nEverybody see me eatin', now they wanna take a bite\nSo I'm like, \"Okay... no way\"\nYeah, when it comes to this shit, man, I don't play\nI'm like Houdini in my Ghost, you can't see me, I'm gone\nBall so hard, I gotta wear my Yeezys to prom\nYouTube bitches asking me to retweet they song\nI'm the reason people got Spotify Premium on\n\n[Hook 9]\nLike, ayy, yo, what you say, though?\nYeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though\nYeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low\nYou know I'm runnin' to them checks like Usain Bolt\n\n[Verse 31]\nSo I'm like okay, nah, no way\nWhen it comes to that shit, man, I don't play\nIf you ask me how I got it I will say\nI got the drive, yeah, really get out of the roadway, uh\n\n[Interlude 8]\nDamn\nSome of these\nAre too slow and also too fast\nWhatever\n\n[Verse 31]\nI'm out of order, three hoes like I'm Santa Claus\nPull up on your bitch, Bape hoodie with a camouflage\nHey now, yo, what's the play now?\nI'm tryna slide, I ain't talkin' 'bout a playground\nYeah, I remember all them days I would stay down\n20K's chillin' in my PayPal\nSo what the fuck you wanna say- you wanna say now? Nothin'\nBest in my town and that's no discussion\nHumble beginnings, ain't humble, we winnin'\nIf I wanna brag, that's my humble decision\nEverything I do is goin' off\nSo if I wanna freestyle, then you better know the cost, ayy\n\n[Interlude 10]\nI think she blocked me\nDamn\nThere's no more water, I'm literally about to die\n\n[Hook 9]\nI think she blocked me on the Instagram\nI need to know, what did I do? I guess I missed your plan\nMe, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?\nI'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand\nI need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn\nPlenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman\nSee, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man\nDiggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man\n\n[Verse 32]\nHow am I gonna let all of this get to me?\nBeen a few months since you texted me\nShit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity\nAin't no way that this can get to me\nAnd in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter\nBut right now, it's feeling like everything\nThe more I talk about it, it just gets sadder\n'Member thinkin' about a wedding ring\nBut now I'm thinkin' 'bout so many things\nWhat did I do to deserve it?\nThis shit the most petty of petty things\nI'll stick with how nobody's perfect\nLike all of my life, I'll forget about it\nAnd all of the things that I said about it\nBut why the fuck did I get blocked?\nI just cannot wrap my head around it\n\n[Interlude 11]\nI just can't wrap my head around it\nNow I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin' up all the flows\nJust for the fun of it\nIf you're still watchin' this shit, uh, comment, uh...\nComment \"Arrowhead water\" in the comments\nAnd let me know what-what would you rate this out of ten\nGive me a rating, that way know that you're real-\nThat you're real one, you know what I'm sayin'? Alright, here we go\n\n[Verse 33]\nSpectacular speculations\n-Havin' some reservations\nImaginin' all the statements\n-Travellin' through these places\nBack in, then buy some passionate\nTrashin' of reputations\nThey actually don't have facts, and\nReality left them baseless\nI wish that we left 'em nameless\n-'Sociate 'em with faces\nMake judgments from expectations\nAnd watch as their heads are shaking\n-People want me to crumble\nAnd turn to some medication\nTo fuck up my motivation\nAnd focus on education\n\n[Hook 10]\nBut I'm petty, petty, petty, petty\nThat's all they really ever tell me\nSo many times that you convince me of shit\nThat I swear you could've won an Emmy\nI got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram\nAnd I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand\nI think t' 'ove is eith-either gold or a scam\nAnd you never really know till the end, like, how all this began\n\n[Verse 34]\nI've been comin' at this as a man\nTrying to figure out where I fit into the plan\nHow does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly\nAnd I don't wanna hear about this shit again\nI guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me\nAnd do anything to try and stop me\nI did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes\nWhen a basic bitch try to block me, uh\n\n[Verse 35]\nLivin' life, but you're stayin' the same\nHow you expect yourself to go take the fame\nMake your name, but you don't take the pain\nYou wanna be unique but not make a change\nLike, what?

Ayy\nLet's gom random shit, ayy\n\n[Verse 39]\nI take no credit for anything that I do\nThat's how I live life with a positive attitude\nThat's why I've seem pissed, but I'm never gettin' mad at you\nThat's the reason that people mirror my attributes\nWhat I contribute to the world is\nSome crazy shit nobody else's world did\nAnd I'm just tryin' to spread some peaces love\nBut, man, it's really hard, 'cause you need some luck\nI've been waitin', 'cause this is\nThe best time for me to be layin' out of business, uh\nAnd I'm breathin' in the air, but it all tastes tainted\nWhen all of this time is wasted, really ain't wasted\n\n[Interlude 14]\nThis is trash, I have- don't know when I wrote this\nI think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-\nThis is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this\nLet's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this\n\n[Verse 40]\nIt's bumpin', bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'\nYou leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'\nI'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'\nThat's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion\nMan, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm\nDroppin' my head, fancy snares, then when it hits 'em\nIt really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me\nBass and a good groove is really a great recipe\nCan't mess with me, no one- feelin' too good in the moment\nFeelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over\nAnd I'm noddin' yes, and then I am applaudin' next\nAnd then, I'm tryna to mentally send God a text\nLike, \"Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real\nBut, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel\nLike a god\u2014 well, you get what I'm sayin'?\"\nAnd goddamn, I just can't really express when I'm playing\n\n[Hook]\nI said it's bumpin', uh- y'all just go for a ride\nWe feelin' good at the top, man, we more than high\nYeah, we be feelin' it, know that this the realest shit\nAll the pain, this is healin' it, love it, I'm never leavin' it\nIt's bumpin'\n\n[Verse 41]\nReally, this is bumpin' to me\nYou ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave\nBut this is something to me, so don't come runnin' to me\nI said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream\nNo, never mind, probably not\nBut I constantly got energy that's lost in my thoughts\nAnd I'm not gonna stop, and yes, this may be costing a lot\nBut lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot\nAnd no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this, I'm still trying to master this\n'Cause now, I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid\nThe fact of it is that it is really just a giant hobby\nSomething for me to be original, not a lyin' copy\nTryna make some shit where you can really get your head nodding\nVerses so fire that- 's when it's done, it's- left sobbing\nBlah, blah, blah, it's uh- we just a work-in-progress\nSome of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense\nBut now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'\nSee me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjustin', see me bluffin'\nEvery day, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do\nListen to some good shit, tryna make a substitute\nI got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too\nWho just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who\nBut all I know is that we find a safety in rhythm\nAnd that is the reason that I am making a shipment\nI said it's bumpin'\n\n[Interlude 15]\nNearin'- we're nearin' an hour\nIf you're still watchin' this shit, I love you, I actually, like, love you\nLong time, okay\n\n[Hook 13]\nI said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her\nHopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna\nMove with it, ride with it\nIt's my life, the only burden is the time limit\nFuck it, I'm livin', ayy, I said, \"Fuck it, I'm livin'\"\nPeople getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'\nJust because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it\nJust because your life stucks, stop corrupting mine with it\nI messed-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good\nJust because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy\nAyy, ayy, uh\nJust because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, uh\n\n[Verse 42]\nAnd how am I meant to keep my workflow up?\nIf a girl shows up, all my world blows up\nI'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest\nTryna find a brand new motherfuckin' deal\nAll you bitches fake, all my numbers real\nAll my shit is punchin' in your stomach, like a meal\nAm I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?\nIt's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing\nNow, it's scary for a king, damn, I said, it's scary for a king, even\nThey call me odd, but I bring even\nI bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and\nThe meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons\nYeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'\nI'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people\nMan, I don't know people who so equal\nI don't know nobody who doesn't own evil\nMan, that is just a truth and a lie\nA truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky\nOr a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind\nNew to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise\nAnd uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit\nOh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this\nYou get discouraged for one minute\nAnd the next one, you be callin' it quits\nAnd I'll probably get rich If I focus enough\nYou close-minded, let's open it up\nAnd all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'\nBut they do not know what is up\nUh, I just wish\nThat they'd go away\nAnd I won't obey\nNo, I will never ever show the way\nAnd I will try to mask it up\nWith other jokes on fucking jokes\nAlways playin' G'\nBut now I'm movin' onto other notes\n\n[Interlude 16]\nMy voice is fucking hurting\nIt's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training\nSo I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time\nWithout causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?\nMan, I just live it up\nI'm gonna go a little bit quieter now\nUh-huh\nYeah\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAll of these people keep on changin'\nAll of these times and different phases\nAll of these lights on all these stages\nAll of these sights is so amazing\nYeah, I've seen at least a million faces\nA million times, a million places\nBut when it's all said and done\nI look and I wonder why, uh\n\n[Verse 43]\nEveryone knows that it's so amazing\nAll the support is my motivation\nCompared to the big people at the Capital\nMy name is spelt in lower cases\nPeople loved me before I made it\nPeople liked it before they watched it\nI'm wantin' way too much more than I have\nAnd I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it\nMan on a mission, and I g- vision\nOf talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen\nGotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow\nI'll be the teacher when they need the feature\nGot flow, and it's so damn crazy\nPeople consider me so amazing\nI'm holding control and then folding them verses\nIt hurts because I am on loaded bases\nAdvanced shit, I know the basics\nAlready know them, they're overrated\nMeanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'\n'Cause now I am open for game, and\nI'm charged up\nI ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior\nSo many people they know the players\nDon't know the game and don't know the makers\nDon't know the fakers, but who cares?\nI'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater\nI'm here to go move and just go on the layers\nAnd bitch, I am going so later\nI got time\nMy own lyrics, I got mine\nAnd I'm on time for the wrong lines\nAnd I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go\n\n[Hook 14]\nI've been all on my own\nAll on my own, people keep calling my phone\nWanting to know when I'll be the star of the show\nBut I'm all my own, yeah\nAnd I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it\n'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-\nThe ghost of me is haunting the throne\nSo I'll make it there all on my own\n\n[Verse 44]\nMy intermission is mixing with intermissions\nAnd following intuition conflicting with my decision\nAnd it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval\nAnd it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful\nAnd it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you\nAppearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement\nTo a new type of thing that you can gain from\nTo push away the past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago-\n\n[Interlude 17]\nOh, holy shit!\nI actually reached the end of the beat\nBut I still have, like\nTen-thousand more words\nHold on, I gotta pause this\nHold on, three, it's still one take\n\n[Verse 45]\n-Past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago\nLook at where we been, but imagine where one can go\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nWe now know how much money you can give for a lie\nGive for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?\nWhat's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?\nSo, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen\nAlways been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man\n\n[Hook 15]\nYeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch\nUh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch\n\n[Verse 46]\nI know like four people who truly respect the grind\nAnd it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme\nAnd then if time is money then free time ain't really free\nAnd all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me\n-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree\nI want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me\nIn the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me\nBigger than you, bigger than anybody in history\nThe challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize\nTo satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time\nAnd luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time\nTo learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind\nI'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got\nSeveral different things to potentially make my job\nI want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs\nAnd also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks\nA million- shit, all we ever want is more, really\nAnd once I get three million, I want four milli'\nIt's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle\nWe can never be happy, but that is so vital\n\n[Interlude 18]\nUh\nThose are actually some good lyrics, uh\n\n[Verse 47]\nRebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt\nThey're weaker than previously, her\nBreathing seems to be burnt like free CDs were\nBefore we could be searched, I'm like \"Please, just please work\"\nLike a lenient slave owner\u2014 that's edgy, like gravestones, oh, you get me\nI saved dough for a Bentley, t'ere more than a Chevy\nI play- I play-\n-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?\nUh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do\nDisgusted like, \"Ew\", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true\nI'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do\nIt's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue\nFillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed\nIt gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh\nBut if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?\nAnd why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?\nThat shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up\nBut nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up\nL\u2014\n\n[Verse 48]\n\u2014cay to the Vatican, havin' them\nGood times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when\nI was so young, too young to really know fun\nBut so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up\nDry your eyes and wipe your nose up\nJust keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge\nBut we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate\nSuch a twisted system that we've been given to operate\nI've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake\nWash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed\nYeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away\nAnd it's so far away\n\n[Hook 16]\nThis a civil war\nIt's a fuckin' civil war\nYeah, we be aimin' to the peace\nSo what we killin' for?\nYeah, anymore\nWhat we even livin' for?\nYeah, they be murderin' for peace\nThat is a civil war\n\n[Verse 49]\nYou know- you know they be lookin' at me right now\nLike the sewer system, they about to pipe down\nI've been writin' my essays, my webpage\nYeah, I call that a new construction site now\nBlue's Clues, man, I think I gotta find out\nAll these questions, man, I really wanna hide out\nOr I wanna drop out, maybe learn a lot 'bout\nMy shit before I wait to see it die out\nDamn, I-I just wanna go along\nI'm holdin' strong, I know- I know I'm not the boldest one\nI'm old enough, I'm growin' up, bars so sick, they throwin' up\nThey know what's up, now, I'm in the- now I'm really doin' the\nDoin' in the big leagues like I got drafted\nBefore the year-round hype over March Madness\nWanna get it to where these girls strippin' down\nLike it's no big deal, like we takin' liberal arts classes\nThey be sayin', \"Damn, Ben really got savage\"\nNo, but unlike you, I am not average-\n\n[Interlude 19]\nHold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental\nThis is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick\nI'm gonna fix it, take a pause\nUh, yeah, ayy\n\n[Verse 50]\nI'm addicted to the screen and the validations\nOf people who are thirteen in another nation\nI've been looking for acceptance in the message\nOr a comment on a video, it seems to be wasted\nLike Internet track meets, they erased it\nLook at this shit, I've just recently made it\nThat how it goes when I'm beatin' and breathin'\nAcheivin' and keep on succeedin', they hate it\nY'all lousy and can't breathe all that smoke, bro\nYou doubt me, but you'll see where I go, so\nAllow me to break free from my own dome\nTo get out and be me, believe in my own zone\nThings become intense in the heat of the ozone\nIt's surroundin' me, I need to go home, so\nCan I pretty please just be al-alone?\nNobody to retweet, delete on my home phone\nI ain't gon'-I ain't gon' hop on that drug shit\nWhen they all claimin' they love it, uh\nI ain't gon' hop on that loud shit\nWhen I know I ain't about it, uh\nYeah, they cannot take this away now\nThey have something to say now\nYou cannot order this shit on a takeout\nAll of these bitches is fake now\n\n[Verse 51]\n\u2014My clothes is Japanese, I wear it casually\nAnd I'm a killer on the mic, might cause a couple casualties\n-All I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary\nMan, I said, \"Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy\"\nTrappin' out my PayPal, make it Friends and Family\nNow I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me\nNow I made my checks from Spotify, they pay me handsomely\nI got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity, okay\nEverybody 'round me, they been wasting my time, ayy\nPull up to the functions, see
