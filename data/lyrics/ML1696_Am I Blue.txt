Am I blue?
Am I blue?
Ain't these tears in my eyes
Tellin' you?

[Verse 2]
Am I blue?
You'd be too
If each plan with your man
Done fell through

[Bridge]
Was a time
I was his only one
But now I'm
The sad and lonely one, Lordy

[Verse 3]
Was I gay?
'Til today
Now he's gone, and we're through
Am I blue?

[Instrumental Break]

Was I gay?
'Til today
Now he's gone, and we're through
Am I blue?

[Outro]
Oh, he's gone, he left me
Am I blue?Embed
