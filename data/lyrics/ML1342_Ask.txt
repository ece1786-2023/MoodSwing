Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life you'd like to
Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life you'd like to

[Refrain]
So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say "no," how could I?

[Verse 2]
Coyness is nice and coyness can stop you
From saying all the things in life you'd like to

[Refrain]
So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say "no," how could I?

[Verse 3]
Spending warm summer days indoors
Writing frightening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg

[Chorus]
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that will bring us together

Nature is a language, can't you read?

[Chorus]
So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that will bring us together
If it's not love
Then it's the bomb
Then it's the bomb that will bring us together
So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me, oh
