3 ContributorsBlood Magick Necromance LyricsThe price of illusion, initiating torment
Devoted you travel through the firmament
Advise the devil, to destroy this plane
All hope is fucked, embellished sacred remains

Naths in morte
Blood magick necromance
Feast upon the dead

Countess your mark, breathes the plague
Sordid remains, adorn morbid sanctuary
Lechery addiction, your celestial charms
A glorified impulse, seven severed arteries

Naths in morte
Blood magick necromance
Feast upon the dead

Spit upon a dew drenched breast
Slutfuck necromance, piss rains upon a poisoned sea
Blood magick necromance
Sukkubus: Consume my flesh!

Blood magick necromance
Feast upon the dead
Blood magick necromance
Raped by the elements, forgotten, dismemberedYou might also likeEmbed
