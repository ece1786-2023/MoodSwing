 "lyrics": "6 ContributorsSet Fire to the Face on Fire LyricsFire! fire! fire!\n\nOrange yellow and black flesh trees bloom fire fire fire\nI'm trapped inside this motel 6 on fire, fire, fire\nThose young fists clenched in the air\nMake a million millionaires\nSet fire to the ships on fire!\nSet fire to the hips on fire!\n\nConstellations strung up like barbed wire, wire, wire\nI'm drinking cement like it's going out of style, style, style\nThose cold hooks, cemetery claws\nRaking out the infants' jaws\nSet fire to the horse on fire!\nSet fire to the dress on fire!\nSet fire to the stage on fire!\nSet fire to the stars on fire!\n\nNow i'm tied to a seagull's back-yeah, fire, fire, fire\nAnd all those black-haired bandits try to lure me down with their songs and choir, choir, choir\nI'd rather shoot up a syringe filled with fire, fire, fire\nThan go to bed with sounds so vacant and tired tired tired\n\nWhat's the sound of a cashing check?\nWhat's the sound of a gag reflex?\nLike speakers crushed beneath an empty tank\nBlowing the ugly off an airbrushed face\nYou might also likeSet fire to the drums on fire!\nSet fire to the lions on fire!\nSet fire to the house on fire!\nSet fire to the face on fire!Embed"
