1 ContributorNothing Was The Same LyricsVerse 1
Shit ain’t the same
Niggas don’t wanna stay in they own lane
I’m doing alright I’m good I can’t complain
‘Bout a piece of pussy they going against the grain
The sun shining I’m prepared for the rain
You mad I’m late but be glad that I came
That ain’t blood on my shirt bitch I’m covered in stains
Like let me explain
No Batman and Robin I was really robbing
Like I ain’t have a option
Stick up kid rob the plug now I’m running plays like the auction
If I fuck around and get jammed would you write me?
Would you make sure my commissary straight that’s unlikely
I don’t even know why I bothered to ask
I might grab the K and just spaz
I really’ll give my niggas my last
If I was down bad, would you ride ‘til the wheels fell off with expired tags?
I lost my brother an it hurt
But what hurt worse
Is watching my mother shed tears ‘cause her oldest child in a hearse
But that ain’t the half shit get deeper
I hide the pain like I’m holding up strong
Really, I’m getting weaker and weaker and weaker
I had to come to my senses get my shit together
Popped a perky I feel a little better
Devil trying to take me under won’t let him
You can run from the pain
But you damn sure can’t hide
‘Cause I promise it’s gone eat yo’ ass up inside
I got three daughters I gotta provide
Ain’t no pressure like it wasn’t applied
Mary J Blige not gonna cry
Knowing that we fighting to live just to die
You might also likeChorus
An I swear shit ain’t been the same since I lost my brother
I’ve been trying to hide the pain but it’s like you can still see it in living color
An I swear I lost it all ‘cause all we had was each other
You weren’t there so how could you tell me things gonna be better
I swallow my pride
I wiped my eyes
I said I ain’t gone cry
Not in front of my daughters gotta set an example
I can’t lie I tried
I broke down couldn’t hold it inside
We fighting to live just to die
Ain’t no pressure like it wasn’t applied
An I can’t lie shit ain’t like it use to be
An usually I don’t let what the next nigga do influence me
Since my brother told me money talk
Its like I speak it fluently
Running from my past when it catch me what its gone do to me

Verse 2
Those cold nights in a cell
No visitation
Sunny days just precipitation
Fifteen minute phone calls wasted
In the midst of fighting all these cases
I realized who the fuck gone be out there for my babies
Nobody but me
Only the strong survive
Make your mind up decide
You fell in love like Bonnie and Clyde
I ran up a check I’m in full stride
You can be here one day and gone the next
Don’t do something that you know you gone regret
I ain’t get to tell my brother that I love him
Now I’m mad at the world, upset
I thank God that I made it
Twenty odd years rip and running these streets
Go out bad is you crazy
I feel like Tyrese Gibson I’m waste deep
Speaking on the next man situation ain’t one hunna’
The devil devoured the flower my heart crumbled
I’ma fuck around and go crazy
Why do we live?
Why do we die?
What is the purpose?
Suicidal thoughts like is this shit really worth it
What the fuck did I do to deserve this
Hold ya head high when that bullshit start to surface
I’m trying to stay strong for my mama but the shit just ain’t working
Chorus
An I swear shit ain’t been the same since I lost my brother
I’ve been trying to hide the pain but it’s like you can still see it in living color
An I swear I lost it all ‘cause all we had was each other
You weren’t there so how could you tell me things gonna be better
I swallow my pride
I wiped my eyes
I said I ain’t gone cry
Not in front of my daughters gotta set an example
I can’t lie I tried
I broke down couldn’t hold it inside
We fighting to live just to die
Ain’t no pressure like it wasn’t applied
An I can’t lie shit ain’t like it use to be
An usually I don’t let what the next nigga do influence me
Since my brother told me money talk
Its like I speak it fluently
Running from my past when it catch me what its gone do to meEmbed
