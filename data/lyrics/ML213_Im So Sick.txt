I will break into your thoughts
With what's written on my heart
I will break
Break

[Chorus]
I'm so sick
Infected with where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss
Selfishness
I'm so sick
I'm so sick

[Verse 2]
If you want more of this
We can push out, sell out, die out
So you'll (Shut up, shut up, shut up)
And stay sleeping
With my screaming in your itching ears

[Chorus]
I'm so sick
Infected with where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss
Selfishness
I'm so sick
I'm so sick
You might also like[Bridge]
Hear it, I'm screaming it
You're heeding to it now
Hear it! I'm screaming it!
You tremble at this sound
You sink into my clothes
This invasion
Makes me feel
Worthless, hopeless, sick

[Chorus]
I'm so sick
Infected with where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss
Selfishness
I'm so, I'm so sick

[Chorus]
I'm so sick
Infected with where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so (I'm so)
I'm so sick (I'm so sick)
I'm so (I'm so)
I'm so sick (I'm so sick)12Embed
