Come on! (Get up!)
(Get up!) Come along, come on
And get up and get down

[Verse 1]
(Get up!) Get up and get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up!) Get up and get down
Get up and move your feet
(Come on and) Rise, rise, rise
Shake your hips (And wiggle your thighs)
(Get up!) Let me see (I wanna see)
Let me see your tired body come alive
(Get up!) You ain't too old
(You ain't too hip, huh!)
(Get up!) I ain't asking for a cartwheel
(No somersault) Or no flip
(I just want you to ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Get up and get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up!) Get up and get down
Get up and move your feet
(Get up!) Daddy, look at mama
(Look at mama) She's burnin' you up, huh!
(Get up!) To make sure you feel the groove
I think I'll turn the music up
(Get up!) Clap your hands, stomp your feet
(Hey! Get up in time with the music)
Yeah! Get on down with the beat
(I just want you to ooh-ooh-ooh)
