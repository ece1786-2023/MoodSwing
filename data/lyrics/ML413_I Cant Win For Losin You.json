Good to see you again\nGee, it's been a long time\nHow's that new man, Mom and Dad\nSince I told you goodbye?\nNow I'm still the same, still raisin' Cain\nNobody's worried 'bout me\nI come and& I go, just as I please\nSince I set myself free\n\nBut I can't win for losin' you\nI just can't get over you\nBein' footloose and fancy free\nAin't all it's cracked up to be\nAnd the grass ain't no greener\nHere on the other side\nI might win a heart or two\nBut I can't win for losin' you\n\nWell I'm on my way, there's so much to say\nLord knows that I've had my time\nGirl, you can bet I'll never forget\nWhen you used to be mine\n\nBut I can't win for losin' you\nI just can't get over you\nBein' footloose and fancy free\nAin't all it's cracked up to be\nAnd the grass ain't no greener\nHere on the other side\nI might win a heart or two\nBut I can't win for losin' youYou might also likeEmbed"
