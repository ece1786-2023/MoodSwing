5 ContributorsI’m Leaving You Because I Don’t Love You Lyrics[Chorus]
I am leaving you because I don't love you
I am leaving you because I don't love you

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's the knowledge, it's the knowledge, it's the knowledge of future clarity
That makes my voice tremble with greater dignity

[Chorus]
I am leaving you because I don't love you
I am leaving you because I don't love you

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry I have to be this brutally, honestly cold
But my excuses were babies of snow that I just could not hold

[Refrain]
So you pick up your asthma inhaler and put it 'gainst your lips
Oh, those lips I've loved, that I was dreaming of
They're still red and soft, I'm so sorry I couldn't love you enough
I'm so sorry I couldn't love you enough
I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
But I'm leaving you because I don't love you
I am leaving you because I don't love you
You might also like[Refrain]
So you pick up your asthma inhaler and put it 'gainst your lips
Oh, those lips I've loved, that I was dreaming of
They're still red and soft, I'm so sorry I couldn't love you enough
So sorry I couldn't love you enough
I'm so sorry1Embed
