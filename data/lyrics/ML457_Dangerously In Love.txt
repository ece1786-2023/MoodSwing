I love you
I love you
I love you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation, in connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you, and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you sometimes makes me wanna cry
I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

[Bridge]
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time, it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me38Embed
