4 ContributorsYou’ve Made Me So Very Happy Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, thank you, baby

[Verse 1]
I've lost at love before
I got mad and I closed the door
But you said, "Why don't you try just once more?"

[Pre-Chorus]
I chose you for the one
Now I'm havin' so much fun
You've always treated me kind
I'm about to lose my mind

[Chorus]
You made me so very happy
And I'm so glad you came into my life

[Post-Chorus]
Came into my life
You came into my life (Thank you, baby)

[Verse 2]
The others, they were untrue
But when it came to lovin' you
I want to spend my whole life with you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you came and you took control
You changed my very soul
You've always showed mе that
Lovin' you is where it's at

[Chorus]
You made mе so very happy
I'm so glad that you came into my life

[Bridge]
I love you so much it seems
That you're even in my dreams
I can hear
I can hear you callin' me (I can hear you callin' me)
I'm so in love with you
All I ever want to do
Is thank you, baby
I wanna thank you, baby

[Chorus]
(You made me so very happy)
I thank you, baby
(You made me so very happy)
I wanna thank you, baby
(You made me so very happy)
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, baby
(You made me so very happy)
I thank you, I thank you, because you
(You made me so very happy)
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, because you
(You made me so very happy)
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, because you
Came into my life
[Post-Chorus]
Came into my life
Yeah baby, you turned my world around
(Thank you, baby) Ooh
I thank you baby for bein' so good to me
Thank you, baby

[Outro]
I wanna thank you, baby
(You made me so very happy)
I, I want to thank you, baby
(You made me so very happy)
I want to thank you for bein' so good to me
(You made me so very happy)
I want to thank you for settin' my whole world free
(You made me so very happy)
I want to thank you for bein' around
(You made me so very happy)
When I need someone to pick me up from fallin' downEmbed
