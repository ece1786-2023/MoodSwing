Oh no)\nIs this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on?\n(Oh, is this the part?) (Don't wipe your feet on me)\n\n[Verse 2]\n[Jane Eugene]\nIf you won't give me what I've been missing\nThen someone else will have to do, oh baby\n\n[Carl McIntosh]\nThen I guess that's how it's got to be\nYou for you, and me for me\n\n[Chorus]\nSlow down\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(Slow down, baby, ooh yeah)\nSlow down\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(Now tell me what you're going through)\n(Don't wipe your feet on me)\n\n[Refrain]\nIs this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on?\n(Is this the part, baby?)\nIs this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on?\n[Chorus]\nSlow down (Slow down now)\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n('Cause I can't take the heat; no, I can't take the heat)\nSlow down (Come on now, slow down)\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(Ooh, slow down)\n\nSlow down\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(Slow...slow down)\nSlow down (You for you...)\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down (And me for me, yeah)\n\nSlow down (I'm on your side)\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(But you move too fast)\nSlow down (Join me)\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down (Slow down, baby)\n(Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on?)\n\nSlow down (Join me)\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(Slow down, yeah; slow down)\nSlow down (I'm in the fast lane now)\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(Oh, this dissipating love with you)\n(Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on?)\nSlow down (Slow)\n'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down...Embed"
