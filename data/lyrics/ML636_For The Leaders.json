 "lyrics": "1 ContributorThis One Is For The Leaders Lyrics[Intro:]\nThis is my appeal\nTo all you leaders out there\nTo stop the war\nCause there is no justifiable reason\nIt's about time\nThat you realize\nThat you're not fulfilling your true purpose\n\n[Chorus:]\nThis one's for the leaders\nWho are fighting war, all over the world\nThis one's for the leaders\nWho are fighting war, all over the world\n\n[Verse 1:]\nThink about the youths\nWho are dying out (dying out)\nCrying out (Crying out)\nFor love\nVictims of the system\nYou're dividing growth\nTo break us down\nAnd tear us apart (tear us apart)\n\n[Pre-Chorus:]\nWhat is the future for the human race?\nHow will the children grow to take our place?\nWhere is the love that we should all embrace?\nI do believe, it's here for you and me\nYou might also like[Chorus:]\nSo this one's for the leaders\nWho are fighting war, all over the world\nThis one's for the leaders\nWho are fighting war, all over the world\n\n[Ad lib:]\nThis one\nIs for\nThe leaders who are fighting war\nAll over the world\n\n[Verse 2:]\nImagine all the money that you spend on arms (spend on arms)\nGuns and bombs (Guns and bombs)\nTo destroy\nWhile people are left hungry\nTo die from wants\nAnd those who dare survive are unemployed\n\n[Pre-Chorus:]\nWhat is the future of the human race?\nHow will the children grow to take our place?\nWhere is the love that we should all embrace?\nI do believe, it's here with you and me\n[Chorus:]\nBut this one's for the leaders\nWho are fighting war, all over the world\nThis one's for the leaders\nWho are fighting war, all over the world\n\n[Outro]Embed"
