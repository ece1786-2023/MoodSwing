Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nCame down upon her head\nClang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nMade sure that she was dead\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again\nTeacher gets annoyed\nWishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene\nShe tells Max to stay when the class has gone away\nSo he waits behind\nWriting fifty times \"I must not be so, o, o, o\"\nBut when she turns her back on the boy\nHe creeps up from behind\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nCame down upon her head (Do-do-do-do-do)\nClang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nMade sure that she was dead (Do-do-do-do-do)\n\n[Verse 3]\nP. C. 31 said, \"We caught a dirty one\"\nMaxwell stands alone\nPainting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh\nRose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery\nSay he must go free (Maxwell must go free)\nThe judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o\nBut as the words are leaving his lips\nA noise comes from behind\n\n[Chorus]\nBang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nCame down upon his head (Do-do-do-do-do)\nClang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nMade sure that he was dead\n\n[Outro]\nWhoa, whoa, whoa-oa\n(Do-do-do-do-do)\n(Silver hammer man)12Embed"
