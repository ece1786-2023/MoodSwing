5 ContributorsYou Donâ€™t Have to Hurt No More Lyrics[Verse 1: Stokley]
I don't like the way he treats you
That's not the way
That I would do you
What gives him the right to say
That its you that he owns
All those nights he left you to cry
Left you with nothing
But tears in your eyes
Girl, just come with me
'Cause this house is not a home

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl he's over and gone
You don't have to hurt no more
And I'll be there for you
To give all the love you yearn for

[Chorus]
And you don't have to hurt no more
Baby, he's over
I'll be what you're looking for
Let me take over
And you don't have to hurt no more

[Post-Chorus]
I'll make you see
I'll be what you're looking for (Yeah)
And more (And more)
So you don't have to hurt
You don't have to hurt
You might also like[Interlude]
No more
How could he look into those pretty eyes
And hurt you?
Oh, no
You don't have to hurt no more

[Verse 2: Stokley]
Every day I see you
With those sad eyes
You try so hard to hold back
From all your cries
Just come with me
There is no reason
For your broken heart to stand
Girl, your heart will heal
From all the pain you feel
Just let me show you
The real love you've been waiting for
Just close the door
You cannot take no more
There is no reason for

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, he's over and gone
You don't have to hurt no more
And I'll be there for you
To give all the love you yearn for
[Chorus]
You don't have to hurt no more
Baby, he's over (He's gone)
I'll be what you're looking for
Let me take over (Let me be the one you need)
You don't have to hurt no more

[Post-Chorus]
I'll make you see
I'll be what you're looking for
And more
So you don't have to hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, he's over and gone
You don't have to hurt no more
And I'll be there for you
To give all the love you yearn for

[Chorus]
You don't have to hurt no more
Baby, he's over
I'll be what you're looking for (All these nights he left you to cry)
Let me take over (Let me take over)
You don't have to hurt no more
[Post-Chorus]
I'll make you see
I'll be what you're looking for (Looking for)
And more
So you don't have to hurt

You don't have to hurt no more
Baby, he's over
I'll be what you're looking for
Let me take over
You don't have to hurt no more

I'll make you see
I'll be what you're looking for and more
So you don't have to hurt
You don't have to hurt no more

[Outro: Stokley]
Spent too many nights alone
Just hurting (oh no)
You don't have to hurt
He must be a fool
To leave you alone2Embed
