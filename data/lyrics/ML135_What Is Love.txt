I love you whether or not you love me
I love you even if you think that I don't
Sometimes, I find you doubt my love for you but I don't mind
Why should I mind? Why should I mind?

[Pre-Chorus]
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

[Verse 2]
Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear?
Never worry never be sad
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can
This is why I don't mind you doubting

[Pre-Chorus]
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

[Verse 3]
And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be
The door always must be left unlocked
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you
And not to spend the time just doubting

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
