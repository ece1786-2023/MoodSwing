(So, darling, I can dream on it too)

[Verse 1]
Send me the pillow that you dream on
Don't you know that I still care for you?
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So, darling, I can dream on it too

[Verse 2]
Each night while I'm sleeping, oh, so lonely
I'll share your loving dreams that once were true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So, darling, I can dream on it too

[Verse 3]
(I've waited so long for you to write me)
But just a memory's all that's left of me
So send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too

[Outro]
So, darling, I can dream on it tooYou might also likeEmbed
