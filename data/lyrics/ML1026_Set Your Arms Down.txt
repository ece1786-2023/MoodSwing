We bring our pocket, our pocket knives
You wanna fight me, you want to fight
Forgotten sense of me, say ah, say ah

And in the backyard into the night
We walk through fire, my love is your flashlight
They wanna fight me, they want to fight
Forgotten sense of me, say ah, say ah, oh...

Walk through the fire
Walk till it gets dark
There is no hiding
To save your life

You've got to try
Say you're me now
Set your arms down

Say ah, say ah
Say ah, say ah
Say ah, say ahSee Warpaint LiveGet tickets as low as $81You might also like5Embed
