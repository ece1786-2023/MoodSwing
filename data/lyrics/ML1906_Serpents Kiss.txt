3 ContributorsSerpentâ€™s Kiss Lyrics[Verse 1]
Covenant of pure corruption
Sink my teeth deep into you
Solemn oath of sheer destruction
Nightmare, through and through

In that hour I'll devour
Hope is swallowed up in pain
Taste the venom, feel the power
Coursing through my veins

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm corruption
I'm destruction, through and through

[Chorus 1]
Trust in me
For I will set you free
With a serpent's kiss

With a serpent's kiss

[Verse 2]
Be my light and I won't stray, make me beg;
Make me pray
Tell me when to laugh or cry, when to live and when to die
You might also like[Bridge]
Forgotten and betrayed
Rotting and decayed
Left to wither without a voice
Left to slither without a choice

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Crucifier, spitting fire
Say your little empty prayers
This empire growing higher
To this spite, I swear

Sharp tongue severs like a razor
Swimming in a sea of rage
Vindicators, masqueraders
All the world's my stage

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I devour
I empower god of pain

[Chorus 2]
Trust in me for I will set you free
With a serpent's kiss
How could it come to this?
With a serpent's kissEmbed
