 "lyrics": "17 ContributorsFire on the Mountain Lyrics[Verse 1]\nLong distance runner, what you standin there for?\nGet up, get out, get out of the door\nYou're playin cold music on the barroom floor\nDrowned in your laughter and dead to the core\nThere's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town\nTakes a whole pail of water just to cool him down\n\n[Chorus]\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlmost ablaze still you don't feel the heat\nIt takes all you got just to stay on the beat\nYou say it's a livin, we all gotta eat\nBut you're here alone, there's no one to compete\nIf mercy's a business, I wish it for you\nMore than just ashes when your dreams come true\n\n[Chorus]\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nLong distance runner, what you holdin out for?\nCaught in slow motion in a dash for the door\nThe flame from your stage has now spread to the floor\nYou gave all you had. why you wanna give more?\nThe more that you give, the more it will take\nTo the thin line beyond which you really can't fake\n\n[Chorus]\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\nFire! Fire on the mountain!\nFire! Fire on the mountain!5Embed"
