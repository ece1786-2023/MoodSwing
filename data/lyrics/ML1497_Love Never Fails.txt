4 ContributorsLove Never Fails Lyrics[Verse 1]
We hope and pray love will find us
And we often stay in spite
All the shame
We try to hide from the pain
I hope that you love again
And I want you to understand
You're my joy, girl
My love won't fail you now

[Interlude]
We've said our goodbyes (Baby)
And you're no longer mine (Hey)
But remember one thing (Hey, girl)
My love for you will never fail

[Verse 2]
Have shame on you
And have shame on me
Stayin' here for so long
When we both know it was so wrong, baby
I want for you something better
And I hope you do stay forever
In my heart, girl
My love won't fail you now
But what we had would never last today, baby, oh
My love girl, yeah
My love won't fail you now
In my heart you'll stay
