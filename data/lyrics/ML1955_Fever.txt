9 ContributorsFever Lyrics[Intro]
(Hey)

[Verse 1]
I got a rip in my pants and a hole in my brand new shoes
I got a Margarita nose and a breath full of Mad Dog Booze

[Chorus]
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they threw me out of jail I tell you it ain’t fair
I tried to kiss the judge from the electrical chair
Yeah we're all here 'cause we're not all there tonight

The guitar's cranked and the bass man's blown a fuse
And when the whole gang bangs tell me then what's your excuse?

[Chorus]
We got the fever, fever, fever, fever

[Verse 3]
Fever gives you lust with an appetite
It hits you like the fangs from a rattlesnake bite
We're all here 'cause we're not all there tonight!

We can't run away from trouble
There ain’t no place that far
But if we do it right at the speed of light
There's the back seat of my car, caviar

[Verse 4]
I was feeling so high I forgot what day
Now I'm feeling low down even slow seems way too fast
And now the booze don't work and the drugs ran out of gas

[Chorus]
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever

[Verse 5]
The buzz that you be getting from the crack don't last
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass
Yeah we're all here 'cause we're not all there tonight

[Bridge 2]
My first time ever lover
We fell asleep out on the lawn
And when I woke up I was all alone
Makin' love to the Crack of Dawn
So yo, I beg your pardon sir
The gangster of love rides again
[Harmonica Solo]

[Chorus]
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever

[Outro]
Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear
As long as I'm in heaven honey I don't care
You look so good baby look so fine
I tell you you're the image of the perfect crime
You gets so tired holding on so tight
If you think you're going crazy well you may be right
Yeah, we're all here 'cause we're not all there, that's right!Embed
