5 ContributorsGoing Where the Lonely Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
Rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go
Anywhere the lights are low
Going where the lonely go

[Verse 2]
Making up things to do
Not running in all directions trying to find you
I'm just rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go

[Verse 3]
And I've got to keep going
I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come
Where there's loneliness all around

[Verse 4]
I've got to keep going
Traveling down this lonesome road
And I'll be rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go

[Verse 5]
I've got to keep going
I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come
Where there's loneliness all around
You might also like[Verse 6]
I've got to keep going
Traveling down this lonesome road
And I'll be rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely goEmbed
