8 ContributorsFire Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm driving in my car
I turn on the radio
I'm pulling you close
You just say no
You say you don't like it
But girl I know you're a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Oh, fire

[Verse 2]
Well, late at night
I'm takin' you home
I say I wanna stay
You say you wanna be alone
You say you don't love me
But you can't hide your desire
When we kiss
Oh, fire
Fire

[Bridge]
You got a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool
Your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool

Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
You can bet
Their love they couldn't deny
Your words say split
But your words they lie
When we kiss
Oh, fire
Fire
