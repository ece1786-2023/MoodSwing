 "lyrics": "1 ContributorWhat Kind Of Man LyricsI cheated on my love\nI cheated on my taxes\nBurned bridges, ground axes\n\nI stole cars, I stole dope\nLeft scars, killed hope\n\nWhat kind of man do you think I am, babe?\nOne twist and I'd do it all again, babe\nWhat kind of man got these holes in his mind?\nDo the same thing over and over again\nExpecting something different this time\nWhat kind of man do you think I am?\n\nI'm livin' in your house\nI'm holdin' your hand\nSleepin' in your bed\nCookin' in your pan\n\nYou see the man who loves you\nYou see the man you love\nBut I have hidden claws\nInside these gloves\n\nWhat kind of man do you think I am?\nOne twist and I'd do it all again\nWhat kind of man got these holes in his mind?\nDo the same thing over and over again\nExpecting it'd be different this time\nWhat kind of man do you think I am? Give it\nSee John Hiatt LiveGet tickets as low as $109You might also likeCome clean and stand tall\nTo thee thine own self be true\nBut sometimes I don't know\nWho's foolin' who\n\nIt's not place to question\nNot my place to know\nNow tell me\nWhat kind of man gonna run this kind of show?\n\nWhat kind of man do you think I am, babe?\nAnother thing comin' if you think I can, babe?\nPick you up every chance I get\nWell, I've broken your heart for no other reason\nThan my mind was already set\nOh, what kind of man?\nWhat kind of man do you think I am?\n\nWhat? What? What?\nWhat kind of man do you think I am?\nOh, what kind of man?\nWhat kind of man do you think I am?\nWhat kind of man do you think I am?Embed"
