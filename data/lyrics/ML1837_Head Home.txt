6 ContributorsHead Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
No one seems to be around
Today they must've all gone off without me again

[Refrain]
I think I'll head home

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll find them gathered 'round my doorstep
Oh, to sleep in a comfortable bed

[Refrain]
I think I'll head home
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh

[Verse 1]
No one seems to be around today
They must've all gone off without me again

[Refrain]
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home

[Chorus]
Bring me a day full of honest work
And a roof that never leaks
I'll be satisfied
You might also likeBring me the news all about the town
How it struggles to help all the farmers out
During harvest time

But there's someone I'd like to see
She never mentions a word to me
She reads Leviathan

[Refrain]
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Bring me a day full of honest work
And a roof that never leaks
I'll be satisfied

Bring me the news all about the town
How it struggles to help all the farmers out
During harvest time

But there's someone I'd like to see
She never mentions a word to me
She reads Leviathan
[Outro]
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home

I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home

I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home1Embed
