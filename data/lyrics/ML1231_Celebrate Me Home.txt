7 ContributorsCelebrate Me Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
Home for the holidays
I believe I've missed each and every face
Come on and play one easy
Let's turn on the love lights in the place
It's time I found myself
Totally surrounded in your circles
Oh my friends

[Chorus]
Please celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please celebrate me home
Play me one more song
That I'll always remember
I can recall whenever I
Find myself too all alone
I can sing me home

[Verse 2]
Uneasy highway
Traveling where the westerly winds can fly
Somebody try to tell me
But the man forgot to tell me why
I gotta count on being gone
Come on mama
Come on daddy
Hear what you want from me yeah
I'll be strong and
I'll be weak
You might also like[Chorus]
Please celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please celebrate me home
Play me one more song
That I'll always remember
I can recall whenever I
Find myself too all alone
I can sing me home

[Bridge]
(I can make believe I've never gone)
(I never know where I belong)

[Chorus]
Please celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please celebrate me home
Play me one more song
That I'll always remember
I can recall whenever I
Find myself too all alone
I can sing me homeEmbed
