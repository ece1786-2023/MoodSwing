4 ContributorsEnd Times Lyrics[Verse 1]
Eyes that speak of distance
Nights are endless white
Seeing specters in my dreams
Feel them seep inside

[Chorus]
So long

[Verse 2]
We've lost faith in reason
It cursed the land with blight
Kodak landscape of my past
A burial in ash

[Chorus]

[Outro]
On and on and on and onYou might also like3Embed
