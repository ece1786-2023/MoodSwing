 "lyrics": "1 ContributorSleep Forever LyricsYesterday the sky was cold and grey\nKept me as a prisoner in my home\nGround through my door when I was all alone\nScowled down on me laughed with the Sun\nAs he hid himself from darkness from everyone\n\nThe sky sometimes, so unkind, first he rains and then he shines\nWhen he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place\nWhen he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place\nI will love you 'til the sky above you, shatters over you and me\nAnd lays us down to sleep forever, la-la-la-la\n\nThe sky today was brilliant and blue\nBrightened up the walkway to my door\nBrought you as a sunbeam on my floor\nBeamed you down on me from the other side\nBrought you up to me across the ocean wide\n\nThe sky sometimes so unkind then again he\u2019s my best friend\nWhen he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place\nWhen he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place\nI will love you 'til the sky above you, shatters over you and me\nAnd lays us down to sleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la\nSleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la\nSleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-laYou might also likeEmbed"
