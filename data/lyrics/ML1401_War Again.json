 "lyrics": "6 ContributorsWar Again LyricsHere we are like we're going to get war again\nComing hard, come and get a gun, join the gang\nWith the bang bang and the same song we sang\nComing over and over again\n\nIt's picking up now, getting more like a game\nAnd it feels real like we learn to fake the fame\nAnd there's never more then one truth\nBut u can always tell your better half\nAlways tell your better half of the story\nIt goes well with the better side of your face u show on TV\nGive me a good reason why I shouldn't start a revolution\nWhat's in the constitution? Is this illusion that we buy?\nYou cut the wings and then you say fly\nYou say the hero is the one that died\nBut the true hero is the one who doesn't live a lie and understands\nThat there's an end out of the cycle\nWho's the master? Who's the disciple?\nYou can do what you can, but will you do it again?\nSo what's the plan?\nLooks like we are going to get war again\n\nHere we are like we're going to get war again\nComing hard, come and get a gun, join the gang\nWith the bang bang and the same song we sang\nComing over and over again\nYou might also likeIt's picking up now, getting more like a game\n\nAnd it feels real like we learn to fake the fame\nAnd there's never more then one truth\nBut you can always tell your better half\n\nLook out\nGoing to get war again, going to get wrong again\nGone again, with the same song again, on again\nCan't be born again, who's gone again?\nWho's going to gain out of this war again?\nHooligan in a tie, rule again\nSoon again u will see it all begin again\nSink again, and that will make you think again\n\nAnd when they call you go\nWhen they are wrong you know\nAnd you will fallow, and you will swallow\nAgain like long ago the bomb will blow\nSo sit back relax and enjoy the show\nCuz you are as cold as snow and I am here below\nI'm going to speak out, scream out\nHere we go, got the fresh flow\nSo before it's over\nThen you are going to find a different kind of war to start again\nGoing to get war againEmbed"
