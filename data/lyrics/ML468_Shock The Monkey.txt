Cover me when I run
Cover me through the fire
Something knocked me out the trees, now I'm on my knees
Cover me, darling, please

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey?
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Fox the fox, rat on the rat
You can ape the ape, I know about that
There is one thing you must be sure of
I can't take anymore
Darling, don't you monkey with the monkey
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey?
Hey, hey
Shock the monkey

Cover me when I breathe
You throw your pearls before the swine, make the monkey blind
