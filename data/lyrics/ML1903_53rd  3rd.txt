1 ContributorHere Today LyricsLeaving home with a buck in my hand
I wanna be a good boy & make a stand
I'm sick of sniffin' glue I just wanna hang around with you

Pleasant dreams didn't know what I was doing
Heading for the road to ruin
Money ain't for sure gimme shock treatment give me more

Nothing to do I stay up all night
Psycho therapy I feel alright with you
So what can I do

Stuck inside but I don't wanna
Sweet sweet little Ramona
Get me out of here today we love so I need you near

I don't care I just wanna be well
Got screwed up they can go to hell
But the spirit still remains (too tough to die)they got shit for brains

Nothing to do I stay up all night
Psycho therapy I feel alright with you
So what can I do

Here today - gone tomorrow I couldn't stay
She's the one - ohyeah
Here today - there is nothing more to say
She talks to rainbows - when I'm far away

All messed up goin' insane
Damn this poison heart it was yours right from the start

I lost my mind it's a real cool time
I'm not jesus baby bye bye
Like a rocket in my vain I wanna do it once againEmbed
