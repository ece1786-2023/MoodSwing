2 ContributorsFetish for the Finite Lyrics[Album version:] (Oh!!)

[Verse 1]
[Laurence Beveridge:]
I have never had a way, with words
But someone out in the night, is waiting for me
(Oh) But can you blame them?
You all see the blood, on my hands
I'm coming out, swear I'm unarmed
Can't you see that there's fireworks, in the sky?
On a night like tonight, could you watch a man die?

[Chorus]
It's a fetish for the finite, that grips my soul
Like a Lucifer love, makes me whole

[Verse 2]
(Oh) At the window, skinless hands, tap glass
I'm handed a spade and I dig through the carpet my grave
Will you do it for me, or must I myself?
Is what I did really so bad?
Can't you see that I'm learning real fast?
I swear by my heart, that this sin is the last

[Chorus]
It's a fetish for the finite, that grips my soul
Like a Lucifer love, makes me whole, woah, woah-oh!

[Bridge]
No justice here, no softness, dear
You can take those things I left there, but don't take my memories
No (no), I can't stand another night, knowing you're not mine
(Oh) You can take those things I left there, but don't take my memories

[Chorus]
It's a fetish for the finite, that grips my soul
Like a Lucifer love makes me whole
Under emerald skylines we fight, for our love
Like militia of the lost, we war, war, war..
[Kier Kemp:] Like militia of the lost
[All:] We war!Embed
