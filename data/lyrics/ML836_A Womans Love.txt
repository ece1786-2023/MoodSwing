3 ContributorsA Womanâ€™s Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I have felt it and I have held it
I have known a woman's love
And I have tasted and I have wasted
A woman's love

[Chorus]
And I know I'll never understand
All the little things that make it grand, a woman's love
And I know I'll never come face to face
With anything that takes the place of a woman's love

[Verse 2]
Well, I have kissed it, tried to resist it
I have missed a woman's love
And I have hated, taken for granted
A woman's love

[Chorus]
And I know I'll never understand
All the little things that make it grand, a woman's love
And I know I'll never come face to face
With anything that takes the place of a woman's love

[Verse 3]
Well, I have needed and I have pleaded
And I have lost a woman's love
And I have worshipped and I have cursed it
A woman's love
You might also like[Chorus]
And I know I'll never understand
All the little things that make it grand, a woman's love
And I know I'll never come face to face
With anything that takes the place of a woman's love

[Outro]
Well, I adore it and thank God for it
A woman's loveEmbed
