2 ContributorsFightinâ€™ For Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well it's late, and you know I've been up drinkin'
Talkin' to myself up and down the hall
Ain't it great, another fabulous disaster
Well I can't wait, for the next hammer fall

[Chorus]
You may have won this battle baby
But it don't mean I won't win the war
And you, you don't even know what it is that you're fightin' for

[Verse 2]
Well it's early, I know you've been up waitin'
Waitin' for me to finally call
Talkin' dirty, it ain't what you really wanted
To slam another phone up against the wall

[Chorus]
You may have won this battle baby
But it don't mean I won't win the war
And you, you don't even know what it is that you're fightin' for

[Bridge]
Well think about me when you're out there honey
You know sometimes that I will
Sometimes I feel like a broken stone rollin' down your hill
You might also like[Chorus]
You may have won this battle baby
But it don't mean I won't win the war
And you, you don't even know what it is that you're fightin' forEmbed
