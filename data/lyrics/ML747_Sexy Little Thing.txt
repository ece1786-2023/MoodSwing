4 ContributorsSexy Little Thing Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Well, she got back and up front
She's everything any country boy need, woo
Inside is outside
Now what you see is what she got up her sleeve, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm talkin' tan leather and wild honey
Heavenly fields on a sunny day
All five senses, woo, they're poppin' atcha
Now my little friend is comin' out to play

[Chorus]
I just love, love, love
That sexy little thing
I love, love, love, woo
That sexy little thing

[Verse 3]
Well, I wanna roll all up in it
Get my sticky fingers all squeaky clean, woo
It's stretched out and hardly fittin'
Got my buttons poppin' off my chest
