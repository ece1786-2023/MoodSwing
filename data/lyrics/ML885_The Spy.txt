I'm a spy
In the house of love
I know the dream
That you're dreamin' of
I know the word
That you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear

[Chorus]
I'm a spy
In the house of love
I know the dream
That you're dreamin' of
I know the word
That you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear

[Bridge]
I know everything
Everything you do
Everywhere you go
Everyone you know

[Chorus]
I'm a spy
In the house of love
I know the dream
That you're dreamin' of
I know the word
That you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear
