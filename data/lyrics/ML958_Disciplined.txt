1 ContributorDisciplined Lyrics[Chorus]
This is times of battle
This is times of war
This is time for discipline
No mercy for a war whore

[Verse 1]
Life turns harsh
But lust doesn't disappear
Life turns dark
But attraction is still there
To taste the forbidden
To dance with the wolves
Erotic deceit
Pleasure above rules

[Chorus]
This is times of battle
This is times of war
This is time for discipline
No mercy for a war whore

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
This game, this flirt will come to an end
Power will change
Our nation will rise again
The hordes will scream for your death
They will claim revenge
They will ravage your body
They will serve you hell

Spitting in the eyes of your defenders
With open legs you surrender
Embracing the muscular overpower
Our pride you so simply devourEmbed
