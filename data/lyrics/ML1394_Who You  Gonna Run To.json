LyricsI don't think it's right\nLettin' love ruin my life\nBut I don't think it's wrong\nGettin' a little revenge in a song\nIt hurts, don't lie\n\nWho you gonna run to?\nWho you gonna run to now?\nYou know I woulda died for you for you\nBut it wasn't like you loved me anyhow\nYou know I'm right\nYou know I'm right\n\nMaybe I been wrong\nMaybe I been livin a little headstrong\nBut no it isn't right\n(Start) Startin' a war by avoiding a fight\nIt hurts, don't lie\n\nWho you gonna run to?\nWho you gonna run to now?\nYou know I woulda died for you\nBut it wasn't like you loved me anyhow\nYou know I'm right\nYou know I'm right\nYou might also likeWho you gonna run to?\nWho you gonna run to now?\n\nWho you gonna run to?\nWho you gonna run to now?\n\nWho you gonna run to?\nWho you gonna run to now?\n(you know I'm right)\n\nWho you gonna run to?\nWho you gonna run to now?\n(you know I'm right)Embed"
