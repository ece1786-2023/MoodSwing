SUBWAY CAR - DAY\nCommuters crowded in sardine silence.  Idle gazes on - a\ngirl. Asleep?  Passed out?  She is SARAH, late 20\u2019s, a born\noutsider traveling light, probably in flight. She dreams\nlike a dog, animated ...\nA FAT MAN eyes her. So does a LITTLE GIRL holding her MOM's\nhand.\nSarah jolts awake, dissociated, freaked out.  Where the fuck\nam I?\nShe pulls herself together.  Checks her bag as if used to\nbeing robbed.  Her knuckles are cut. She takes in the train,\nall those judging eyes. The Fat Man is still leering.\nSARAH\nWhat?\nFAT MAN\nWakey-wakey.\nSARAH\nYou like sleeping girls, lard ass?\nIs that your bag?\nSarah carries more than a trace of a working class English\naccent, and this is North America.  He turns his back.  She\u2019s\nmaking everyone uncomfortable.  Sarah sees the Mom try to\nshield the Little Girl from it.  Instant regret.\nSARAH (CONT'D)\nSorry, honey.\nThe train squeals into a station.  Doors open. Sarah takes\nthe chance to push blindly out, past the Mother.\nSARAH (CONT'D)\nSorry.\nINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY\nThe train pulls away.  Commuter crush on the platform thins.\nSarah\u2019s breathing slows, she pulls herself together.\nOkay, assess.  She checks her jeans pockets - a five dollar\nbill and some change.  Cell phone in the inside pocket of\nher beat up leather jacket.  In her purse, a plastic water\nbottle.\nShe unscrews the cap, tilts back the bottle and drinks.\nThen something odd catches her eye.\n\ufffc\nANGLE ON:  OPPOSITE PLATFORM\nA well dressed WOMAN, back turned, crouching down, slipping\noff her heels.  She takes off her suit jacket, folds it\nneatly, places her purse and shoes on the jacket in a neat\npile on the floor.  A train approaches, rising thunder.  She\nstraightens up, turns towards us ...\nTHE WOMAN IS HER. Sarah gasps, time slows.  A twin - better\ndressed, different social strata - but identical.\nThe bottle falls out of Sarah\u2019s hand.  Water leaks out across\nthe platform.\nAnd then the Woman sees Sarah.  A frozen moment of contact\n... and in her eyes, Sarah sees  - fear, confusion.\nThe train roars into the station, and without hesitation,\nthe Woman steps off the platform DIRECTLY INTO ITS PATH.\nBlood spatters everywhere.  Brakes squeal.  Commuters scream.\nSarah stands stock still, her brain overloading.  At her\nfeet, blood droplets swirl in spilt water.  She raises a\nhand, wipes a drop of blood from her lip, looks at it on her\nfinger ...\nAnd snaps out of it, noise and confusion rushing back.  She\nstarts walking, breaks into a run ...\nINT. SUBWAY STATION, VARIOUS - DAY\nSarah forgoes a crowded ESCALATOR and runs up the stairs\nbeside it.  She turns a corner at the top.\nRuns along a wide, tiled HALLWAY, rounding another corner to\nconfront ...\nA MOB welling up from the other platform, freaked-out by the\nsuicide.  She steels herself, pushes down against them ...\nINT. OPPOSITE SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY\nSarah emerges against the flow. Train emptying, platform\nclearing, TRACK WORKERS on radios, a few macabre\nRUBBERNECKERS.  Way more blood spatter this side.  Sarah\nwalks to where she can see ...\nThe body on the tracks:  shattered and contorted, but the\nface still intact, eyes staring -- it\u2019s her.\nSarah rips her eyes away, spots ... the woman\u2019s personal\neffects, unnoticed, piled so neatly aside.  She slides over,\nsnags the purse.\nPurse in hand, Sarah joins the tail end of the commuter flow\nout.\nEND TEASER\n\ufffc\nACT ONE\nEXT. SUBWAY EXIT, DOWNTOWN - DAY\nShe\u2019s disgorged among the crowd, clutching the out-of-\ncharacter purse.  Daylight hits her, street noise.  She pulls\naside to get her bearings.  Skyscrapers tower all around,\ndisorienting.  She picks a direction, heads off, holding\nherself to a fast walk.\nINT. BATHROOM - DAY\nShe rifles the purse in a filthy stall.  A wallet, find the\nID:  Too fucking weird, herself staring back.  Name:\nSARAH\nElizabeth Childs ...\nCount the money.  $140, into her pocket.  Two phones, one\nexpensive, one cheap pink plastic, pocket them.  A big set\nof keys with an electronic swipe card attached.  Take those\ntoo.  Go back and take the credit cards.  The rest is crap.\nExit the stall, purse into garbage, cover it with trash.  A\nbreath, a moment in the mirror. Wipe away another blood spot.\nHoly fuckin shit.\nINT. OLLY\u2019S TAVERN - DAY\nA skid bar, almost empty.  Sarah comes out of the bathroom,\nsteps to the sketchy BARTENDER.\nSARAH\nBourbon rocks.\nThe Bartender pours, eyes her curiously.\nBARTENDER\nDo I know you?\nSARAH\nMaybe.  I haven\u2019t been around for a\nwhile.\nBARTENDER\nYeah.  Thought I seen you before.\nINT. OLLY\u2019S TAVERN - LATER\nSarah at a table, four drinks in.  She fidgets, not good at\nsitting still.\nDoor opens.  A skinny-assed hustler enters. FELIX, worldly\nbeyond his 23 years, all of them gay. He's Sarah's foster\nbrother, the closest thing either of them have to family. He was younger than her when they emigrated, so he carries no\nEnglish accent unless he wants to put it on. Sarah stands to\nhug him, an air of codependency beneath their banter.\nFELIX\nOh my God, you look like crap.\n(hug ends, regard her)\nSeriously, Sarah -- ew.\nSARAH\nHow\u2019s life, Felix?\nFELIX\nOperatic.\nSARAH\nWant a Bellini or something?\nFELIX\nFuck off. This long no see, you don\u2019t\nget to be the bitch.  I do.\nSARAH\nI didn't miss your Birthday.\nFELIX\nI know, totally pedestrian and the\nonly reason I\u2019m here.\n(to Bartender)\nGuiness, Jack.\n(then)\nSo.  How\u2019s Vic the Dick?\nSarah drums her fingers.  How much should she tell him?\nSARAH\nI hit him first this time.\nFelix raises an eyebrow.\nSARAH (CONT'D)\nWith an ashtray, so, you know ...\npretty sure it\u2019s time to move on.\n(beat)\nI'm here for Kira, Fee.\nFELIX\nMrs. S isn't going to let you just\ntake her.\nSARAH\nShe's my daughter, she's going to\nhave to.\n5.\nFELIX\nIt's been almost a year, Sarah.\nSarah\u2019s not proud of that.\nFELIX (CONT'D)\nNot judging, just saying.\nSARAH\nSo I'm back, on the run.  The usual\nSarah shit, right?\n(Felix shrugs, kinda)\nWell on that joyous note, something\nawfully fucking weird just happened\non the subway.\nFELIX\nWhat?\nSARAH\nI saw a girl kill herself.\nFELIX\nEw.  A jumper?\nSARAH\n(nods)\nAnd she ... She looked exactly like\nme, Felix.\nFELIX\nWhaddaya mean?\nShe pulls the girl\u2019s stuff out of her pockets and lines it\nup on the table:  Keys, ID. One pink phone, one black.  Felix\nblanches.\nFELIX (CONT'D)\nYou robbed her body?\nSARAH\nNo.  She left her purse on the\nplatform.\nShe slides the drivers license to Felix.  He picks it up.\nLong pause.\nFELIX\nOkay, that\u2019s weird.\nYa think?\nSARAH\n6.\nFELIX\nIt\u2019s you with a nice haircut ... and\na nice address.\nShe takes the ID back and examines it again.\nSARAH\nWhat the hell, Fee?  Did I have a\ntwin sister?\nFELIX\nWell, when you\u2019re a poor little\norphaned foster wretch, anything\u2019s\npossible.  Or so we tell ourselves.\nSARAH\n(pause, off the ID)\nI've go to go up to her flat.\nFELIX\nTo find out who she is, or to rob\nthe rest of her shit?\nSarah checks the key ring.\nSARAH\nNo car. There has to be a car.\nThe black phone rings, startling them.  Sarah checks the\ncaller ID:  Art.  Shows it to Felix.\nFELIX\nAnswer it.\nAs if.  Sarah pockets the phone, gathers the other effects.\nFELIX (CONT'D)\nWhat about Vic?\nShe kisses him on the cheek.  He doesn\u2019t reciprocate.\nSARAH\nI\u2019ll call ya.\n9    EXT. BETH\u2019S BUILDING - DAY                                    9\nOn a wide, empty sidewalk.  Sarah checks the address of the\ndrivers license.  Looks up at a sleek, high end building.\nNice.\n10   EXT. BETH\u2019S BUILDING, ENTRYWAY - DAY                          10\nA bank of buzzers.  Swipe the key card, lock tumbles, slip\nin ...\n7.\n11   EXT. BETH\u2019S BUILDING, LOBBY - DAY                             11\nCross to elevator, hit the button.  An edgy wait, floors\nticking down.  Shit - a moo-moo wearing WOMAN, 60\u2019s, entering\nthe lobby with a drop-kick sized dog. Sarah keeps her back\nturned.\nWOMAN\nBeth?\nThe dog starts barking at her furiously.\nWOMAN (CONT'D)\nPookie, stop that!\nDing.  Elevator door opens. Sarah quickly hits floor 14.\nWOMAN (CONT'D)\nBeth, hold the --\nThe door slides closed.\n12   INT. BETH\u2019S BUILDING, ELEVATOR - DAY                          12\nQuiet, Sarah tense, floors ticking upwards.\n13   INT. BETH\u2019S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY                           13\nDoor slides open, Sarah steps out.  Subdued lighting, wide\nand quiet.  She slips to door # 1423, listens carefully.\nShe tries a key, another and another, getting frustrated\nuntil ... Bingo.\n14   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, FRONT HALL - DAY                       14\nSarah softly shuts the door, stays still.  Silence.  She\nedges in ...\n15   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY                      15\nHoly shit, you can see for miles.  A sweet pad, not rich,\nbut art on the walls, styley, way out of her league.  She\nexplores.\n16   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DAY                          16\nShe passes the fridge, photos on the door:  \u201cBeth\u201d.  And a\nboyfriend?  One with his shirt off, not bad, but not her\ntype.\n17   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - DAY                          17\nUnderstated, tidy.  Open a closet: girls wardrobe.  Skirt-\nsuits, nice but conservative. An athlete too, gym gear.\nAnother closet: his.\n8.\nThey live together. Suits, shirts, fuckin\u2019 boat shoes and\nchinos.\nSARAH\nSquares.\nBut in Paul's well organized things she spots - a camera.\nShe grabs it.\n18   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - DAY                         18\nA big ensuite.  Check the med cabinet: serious prescription\ndrugs.  All Beth\u2019s - anti-depressants, tranquilizers, a mixed\nbag.  All prescribed by one DR. BOWERS.\n19   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, OFFICE - DAY                           19\nThis looks promising.  Fax and printer on the desk, but no\ncomputer.  A two-drawer file cabinet, rifle it - just bills\nand paper.  Open desk drawers, one by one.  Bingo:  last\ndrawer has cheque books, credit card statements.  Pull the\nwhole thing out of the desk.\n20   INT. FELIX\u2019S LOFT - DAY                                       20\nA dim, open warehouse, high windows, curtains drawn.  Vague\nclutter, art and decay.  Vague decadence: a line of coke\nsnorted, clothing roughly removed.\nTwo men:  An ND executive type, few features, no soul.  And\nFelix, the bottom, tossed around.  Not exactly pleasure, but\nnothing he\u2019d do without.\nLATER: Felix in bed. No conversation, the ND lover dressing,\ndrops a few bills on the dresser on the way out.\nFelix gets up in the gloom.  Lights a smoke. He throws back\na curtain, revealing in detail ...\nArt space, paint splashed.  Canvases and found metal\nsculpture, variations on a fuck you theme.  A lot of it good,\nnone of it finished ... and naked Felix heading for the\nbathroom ...\n21   INT. FELIX\u2019S LOFT - LATER                                     21\nShower running.  A loud door buzzer, someone leaning on it.\nShower dies off, Felix comes out of the bathroom pulling on\na robe.\nFELIX\nOkay, okay, okay!\nHe unlatches and slides open the rolling metal door ...\n9.\nAnd gets grabbed by the throat by VIC, alias \u201cVic the Dick\u201d,\n33, a lean, frustrated bundle of see-saw emotion.  Felix\nain't scared of him, but Vic has him by the windpipe and\ntends to injure.\nFELIX (CONT'D)\nVic?\nVIC\nWhere is she?\nFELIX\nWho?\n(throat grip tightens)\nVic?  ... can\u2019t ...\nVIC\nBreathe?\nFelix struggles, has to beg.\nFELIX\nPlease, Vic ...\nVic relaxes his grip enough to catch a breath.\nVIC\nTalk.\nFELIX\nI haven\u2019t seen her in a year.  I\nswear to God, I don\u2019t want to.  She\u2019s\nnot my problem anymore.\nVic lets him go.  But puts a finger in his face.\nVIC\nBullshit.\nHe takes off his ball cap to reveal a shaved bald spot and a\nbig welt with stitches.\nVIC (CONT'D)\nTell her this didn\u2019t even hurt.\nTell her it makes me happy.\nFELIX\nVic.  You two are poison.  Why don\u2019t\nyou just let her go?\nVIC\nBecause I love her you little\nfuckhead, and we\u2019re not finished.\nNow where\u2019s her kid?\n10.\nFELIX\nI\u2019m not telling you that, Vic.\nVIC\nShe\u2019s with your foster mom, isn\u2019t\nshe?  Mrs. S or P or whatever.\nFELIX\nYou\u2019ll have to beat it out of me,\nI\u2019m afraid.  And I\u2019ll enjoy it.\nVic grabs his face.  Felix struggles.\nVIC\nTell Sarah I\u2019m coming back.  She\nbetter be here, Felix.\n22   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DAY                          22\nCold imported beer in the fridge.  Sarah fishes one out,\ncloses the door.  There\u2019s a piece of paper magnetized to the\nfridge beneath one of the boyfriend photos - a travel\nitinerary, under the name ...\nSARAH\nPaul ...\nShe takes his photo too.\n23   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY                      23\nShe turns on the TV with the remote -- a security camera\nfeed from the lobby entrance.  Nobody there.  She flicks\nthrough a few channels to local news, volume low.\n\u201cBeth\u201d is laid out On the dining table - Paul\u2019s photo on his\ntravel itinerary. The pink and black phones. Paul's Camera.\nShe's going through the office drawer, examining credit\nstatements, checkbooks, bank books.\nThe TV is on, local news, volume low.\nA phone rings - her own.  Check the caller ID, answer.\nFelix.\nSARAH\n24   INT. FELIX\u2019S LOFT - DAY                                       24\nFelix on the phone, examining the bruises on his throat.\nFELIX\nHi Liz.\nINTERCUT:\n11.\nSARAH\nIt\u2019s \u201cBeth\u201d.  My credit is maxed,\nbut I\u2019ve got a sweet pad and my new\nboyfriend Paul is out of town till\nthe weekend.\nFELIX (ON PHONE)\nWell that\u2019s handy.  Unfortunately,\nyour real boyfriend, Vic the Dick,\nis already here.\nSARAH\nFuck.\nFELIX\nI\u2019m fine, thanks for asking.\nSARAH\nSorry.\nFELIX\nNot very.  So is she your twin or\nwhat?\nSarah sighs, going through the last effects in the office\ndrawer.\nSARAH\nI don\u2019t know.  Just a girl who looks\nlike me.  A girl with a pretty nice\nlife.\nFELIX\nIf it\u2019s so nice, why\u2019d she kill\nherself?\nSarah\u2019s fingers find a seam in the bottom of the drawer.  It\nhas a false bottom. She lifts it up to discover -- a bank\nbook.   She opens it.\nHoly shit.\nWhat?\nSARAH\nFELIX\nSARAH\nShe\u2019s got 150 K in a savings account.\nFELIX\nUh.  Say again?\nSARAH\n150 K.  In a hidden account.  Felix,\nthis is enough for me and Kira.\n12.\nFELIX\nTo what, you and Kira?\nSARAH\nGet away. Set ourselves up somewhere.\nIt's not a lot but it's enough to lose bloody Vic.\nFELIX\nWell I want to come.\nSARAH\nYes.  The three of us. Where, West\nCoast?\nFELIX\nUh, first?  Any second someone will\nID that body and it\u2019s over.\nSARAH\nI know, and banks take a couple of\ndays to process a withdrawal this\nsize.\nFELIX\nYou should really get out of there\nright now.\n(silence)\nVic has eight stitches, by the way.\n(silence)\nHello?\nSARAH\nI\u2019m thinking ...\nThe television catches her attention ...\nON TV: A NEWS REPORT\n\u201cCommuter Chaos\u201d title.  Footage of stationary trains; crowds\nwelling up out of the subway; sidewalks over-crowded with\nstranded passenger.  A reporter on the scene mopping up,\nlive after-the-fact.\nREPORTER\n... all trains are running again,\nbut the jumper remains a Jane Doe.\nWitnesses describe her as white,\ntwenties, dark-haired and well\ndressed...\nON SARAH. A Plan of action forming. Don\u2019t analyze, just do.\nSARAH\nFelix, I have an idea.\n13.\nFelix is tenuous, knows her too well.\nFELIX\nOh no ...\nEND ACT ONE\n14.\n\ufffc\nACT TWO\n25   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY                      25\nOpen on VARIOUS HOME VIDEO OF BETH. She's running a 10K race.\nShe's in the finish area, hands on hips, regaining her breath.\nREVEAL:  The footage is on the TV, which is cabled to Paul's\ncamera. Sarah watches intently, soaking in her mannerisms\nand speech.\nMore HOME VIDEO footage. Casual moments.  Beth reads a bit\nof a hard ass. Hard shell, soft center. She doesn't smile a\nlot, but when she does it's warm and fragile. She bites her\nnails. She chews gum. In a telling clip taken without her\nknowing, she looks troubled.\nSarah aborbs her, taking her on, a chameleon shift.\nINTERCUT:\n26   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - DAY                          26\nSarah picks a nice power suit from the wardrobe.  Fits\nperfect.

Then she looks\nat the camera wryly.\nBETH\nYou gonna give me a hand there,\nSpielberg?\nPAUL\nAfter your close up.\nShe splashes water at him with the paddle. Jiggle-cam.\nPAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)\nHey, you'll get it wet!\nBETH\nOh, you're breaking my heart.\n27   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - DAY                         27\nIn the mirror, Sarah 'becomes' Beth, using her make up,\nstyling her hair to match photos stuck to the mirror.\nSARAH\nOh, you're breaking my heart.\n15.\n\ufffcA phone rings off ...\n28   INT. BETH\u2019S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY                      28\nSarah grabs Beth\u2019s phone off the table, the black one that\nrang before.

Finally - bank\nbooks, cheque book.\n29   INT. BETH\u2019S BUILDING, ELEVATOR - DAY                          29\nFloors tick off, too slow for Sarah, 3...2...L.\n30   INT.

Behind the counter is BOBBY,\n30, a blue collar Goth Mother, inherited her name with the\njoint.  She swats Felix with a spatula.\nFelix!\nBOBBY\n16.\nWhat?\nFELIX\nBOBBY\nChill with the jackhammer.

Can I ask where you\u2019re\ngoing?\nSARAH\nAnother institution.\nSTEPHEN RIGGS\nCan I ask why?\nShe smiles a definite \u201cno\u201d.  He clears his throat.\nSTEPHEN RIGGS (CONT'D)\nAll right, we\u2019ll get it processed.\nIf you please authorize, right here.\n(Sarah signs Beth\u2019s\nsignature)\nAnd here.\n(she signs again)\nYou know, I really recommend a\ncashier\u2019s cheque, rather than carrying\nthis amount of cash.\nSARAH\nThank you, Stephen, that won\u2019t be\nnecessary.\nSTEPHEN RIGGS\nWill you be emptying your safe deposit\nbox too?\nSARAH\nYes.  Can we do that now?\nSTEPHEN RIGGS\nDo you have your key with you?\nSarah takes out Beth\u2019s key ring. He spots the key before she\ndoes.\nSTEPHEN RIGGS (CONT'D)\nYes, there it is.  This way, please.\n34   INT. SAFE DEPOSIT ROOM - DAY                                  34\nMr. Riggs uses his key to remove a box from the wall.  He\nputs it on the table for her.\nSTEPHEN RIGGS\nTake your time.\nHe leaves the room. Sarah opens the lid.\n(beat)\n18.\nOne file folder. She opens it - nothing negotiable.  Just a\nphotocopied birth certificate - Beth\u2019s.  Another photocopied\nbirth certificate, this one German, for a \"Katja Obinger\".\nAnother for \"Allison Hendrix\".\nNo time to think about it.  Just take the file, slip it into\nher purse.\n35   EXT. SIDEWALK, NEAR BETH\u2019S APARTMENT - DAY                    35\nSarah hustles back to Beth\u2019s.  So far, so good.  Except the\nheels are killing her. She bends down to take off the shoes,\nand is suddenly struck by a...\nVISION-FLASH:  The train station platform.  Beth bending to\ntake off her shoes, identical.\nSarah stands up quickly, wierded-out in a dead girl's clothes.\nIgnore it, keep walking barefoot, almost \u201chome\u201d.  But as she\nsteps off the curb ...\nAn unmarked police car skids up, cutting her off.  Out hops\na plain clothes COP, early 30\u2019s, black, pissed right off.\nHe eyes the shoes in her hand like she\u2019s crazy.\nCOP\nWhat the hell are you doing?\nSARAH\nIs there a law against walking\nbarefoot?\nCOP\nGet in the car.\nSARAH\nWhy?\nCOP\nDon\u2019t fuck with me, Beth.\nOh no, he knows her.  No choice, she reaches for the back\ndoor.\nCOP (CONT'D)\nIn the front.  I ain\u2019t Drivin\u2019 Miss\nDaisy.\nSARAH\nOkay.  Calm down.\nHe gets in behind the wheel.  Freaking out, she goes around\nto the passenger side...\n19.\n36   INT. COP CAR - DAY                                            36\nGets in.  He pulls out fast, shaking his head in silent anger.\nART\nWhere you been for three days? Huh?\nSarah plays it tight lipped, pissed off right back.\nART (CONT'D)\nYou better be ready.  Are you ready?\nSARAH\nYeah, I\u2019m ready.\nSilence.  He drives aggressively.\nART\nSkip the shrink, that\u2019s your problem.\nYou fuck this up, you fuck me.\nHe\u2019s getting emotional.  She has to say something.\nSARAH\nI know.\nCasting about for clues, she spots a clipboard.  Cop\npaperwork:  Officer Arthur Bell.  Art.\nART\nWe made a commitment.  I crossed a\nline for you.  Suddenly I can\u2019t trust\nyou?  Suddenly I don\u2019t even know\nyou?\nSARAH\nArt.\nBeat. The name sticks. Sarah gives him \"Beth\" attitude.\nSARAH (CONT'D)\nYou're breaking my heart.  Just drive.\nArt glowers.  Sarah stares straight ahead.  This is out of\ncontrol.\n37   INT. MORGUE, CORRIDOR - DAY                                   37\nFelix escorted by COLIN, 29, geek-handsome young morgue\nattendant.  Felix is flustered, finds the whole morgue thing\nkind of creatively juicy and a weird turn on. They approach\nthe cold room doors at the end of the hall.\nFELIX\nAre they in there?\n20.\nYes.\nCOLIN\nColin is about to open the door, Felix balks, a hand on his\narm.\nFELIX\nColin...  Can I call you Colin?\nCOLIN\nMy mum does.\nFELIX\nUh huh.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I usually\nenjoy creepy.  I\u2019m just a little ...\n(flustered)\nCOLIN\nSure.  Take a breath.\nFELIX\n(tries, but)\nThe air in here.  Is that just me?\nCOLIN\nNo.  It\u2019s death.\n(a smile)\nYou can do this.  It can be a gestalt.\nFELIX\n38   INT.

WTF is going on?\nBull through, catch up to Art, make him fall into stride\nacross the lot. Right up the wide front steps, in through\nthe front door.\n42   INT. PRECINCT - DAY                                           42\nShe holds up and lets Art lead.  The DESK SERGEANT stands as\nthey pass, doesn\u2019t like either of them. Why are all eyes on\nher?  A few cold glares, a few nods of encouragement from\nthe rank-and-file. A dark haired woman out of uniform (ANGELA\nDEANGELIS, 30) makes a fist - \u201cstrength\u201d\n43   INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY                                         43\nArt leads them right to a wiry little Napoleon, cue ball\nbald, waiting outside his office door - LIEUTENANT GAVIN\nHARDCASTLE, 50.  He\u2019s got a hate on for Beth.\nHARDCASTLE\nFashionably late, you call that?\nART\nShe\u2019s here, Lieutenant.\nHARDCASTLE\n(to him, then her)\nYou get busy.  You come with me.\nHardcastle leads her off.  Sarah casts a glance back to Art,\nat his desk.  On the desk adjoining his, a nameplate -\nDetective Elizabeth Childs.  Art nods encouragement.  Real\nconcern, her partner, an ally in this skin, but not her own.\nHardcastle, on the other hand, opens a door into a hallway.\nHe glares back at the hanging squad room.\nHARDCASTLE (CONT'D)\nShow\u2019s over!\nHe slams the door behind them.\n44   INT. POLICE PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY                           44\nHe marches her down, interrogation rooms on either side.\nHARDCASTLE\nYou better have your story down,\nChilds.\nHe stops at a door ajar. Inside, Sarah glimpses a Tribunal:\nAn INTERNAL AFFAIRS SUIT, a POLICE CAPTAIN in uniform, and a\n22.\nCIVILIAN POLITICIAN, a woman in her 50\u2019s.  Beth's LAWYER\nwaits at a table  facing them, her chair empty. Hardcastle\nsoftens a shade, offers a crack of encouragement.\nHARDCASTLE (CONT'D)\nStick to your statement, you'll be\nfine.\nShe can\u2019t go in there.  Spots a sign down the hall ...\nSARAH\nI gotta use the bathroom.\n(her general disarray)\nLieutenant.\nHardcastle bristles, but there\u2019s a lot on the line.\nHARDCASTLE\nGet yourself together.\n45   INT. PRECINCT, BATHROOM - DAY                                 45\nSarah steps in, alone, reeling.  Pulls out her phone, dials.\nWaits as it rings, cusses low as she gets a message.\nFELIX (V.O.)\nWhaddaya want?  Leave it for Felix.\nSARAH\nFelix!  Beth is a cop!  I\u2019m a cop,\nFelix!

Can I call you Felix?\nFELIX\nYes, please.\nCOLIN\nThis\u2019ll be shocking, Felix. But for\nher it was instant.\nFelix nods.  Colin unzips the face.  Felix is rocked - he\u2019s\nstaring at a dead, mangled Sarah.  His knees go weak.\nFELIX\nOhhhh my God ... toooo weird ...\nCOLIN\nIt\u2019s okay, lean on me.\n23.\nFELIX\nOhhhh my God ... that is so fucked\nup.\nCOLIN\nHere\u2019s a chair.\nHe sits him down.  Felix wasn\u2019t ready for that.\n47   INT. PRECINCT, BATHROOM - DAY                                 47\nSarah\u2019s got nowhere to turn.  She desperately needs a plan.\nThen she spots the liquid hand soap dispenser, clear\ncolourless soap.  Ah, shit.  She dismantles it quickly.\n48   INT. MORGUE - DAY                                             48\nFelix thankfully drinks a glass of water.\nFELIX\nThank you.  Morgue water?  Delicious.\nCOLIN\nIs it her, Felix?\nFelix takes a big breath and nods.\nCOLIN (CONT'D)\nYour sister.  I\u2019m sorry.\nFELIX\nFoster sister, but close.  We spent\nour \u2018formulative\u2019 years together.\nCOLIN\nWell if you ... need anyone to talk\nto ... over a drink.\nColin is actually blushing.  Not much surprises Felix, but\nthis does.  He reappraises him.\nFELIX\nWell, aren\u2019t you an odd duck?\n49   INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY                                         49\nSarah emerges from the bathroom.  Death march toward\nHardcastle waiting outside the hearing room, a slight wobble\nin her step.  She steps right past him and in.\n50   INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY                                       50\nSarah nods to her grim Lawyer and sits opposite the Tribunal.\nThey\u2019ve been waiting a while.\n24.\nPOLICE CAPTAIN\nNice of you to join us.\nSARAH\nSorry, sir.\nInternal Affairs turns on the tape rig, adjusts the mic.\nINTERNAL AFFAIRS\nAll right. Statement of Officer\nElizabeth Childs, entering into record\nher version of the line-of-duty\nshooting, 7 February of this year,\nresulting in a civilian fatality.\nIn your own words please, begin by\nstating your name.\nSilence.  They wait. Her Lawyer gives her a nod. She opens\nher mouth to speak and closes it again.\nPOLICE CAPTAIN\nAny time, Detective.\nINTERNAL AFFAIRS\nJust relax and tell it like it is.\nSarah shifts in her seat, sweating, going green ... and then\nthe Tribunal scatters as she pukes all over the table.\n51   INT. SQUAD ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                               51\nArt looks up from his paperwork as the Tribunal Members stomp\nthrough wiping themselves down with paper towel.

PSYCHIATRIST\u2019S OFFICE - DAY                              52\nOn DR. ANITA BOWERS, her tired, piercing gaze over bifocals\nand nameplate on piled desk.  Bowers has spent twenty years\ndealing with cops, and a year or so with Beth -- Sarah --\nwho's lying uncomfortably on a couch across the room, ready\nto say anything to get out of there.\nDR. BOWERS\nIt's \"not coming back\" to you?\nSARAH\nNot really. I know I shot a civilian,\nbut I\u2019m missing ...\nDR. BOWERS\nWhat?  Explain.\nSARAH\nMyself.  I glitched, a break or\nsomething. I think I need some ...\nyou know, leave.\nDR. BOWERS\nYou\u2019re under suspension.\nSARAH\nRight.\nDR. BOWERS\nBut I can declare you Unfit. So\ncircumstances aside, let's start with how you feel about shooting this person you don't really remember shooting.\n(refers to notes)\nMaggie Chen. 44. Single, churchgoer.\nWho you mistook for a wanted felon.\nAnd her cell phone for a gun.\nSarah doesn't want to dig any deeper, just shrugs.\nSARAH\nI feel bad.\nBowers is deadpan. She checks her watch, settles back in her\nchair.\nDR. BOWERS\nA cop like you doesn't just accept unfit. And why are you lying down?\n26.\n\ufffcSarah realizes she's made a mistake. Sits up.\nDR. BOWERS (CONT'D)\nA year you've been seeing me and you\navoid that couch like the plague. It\ntells me you're acting. And if you're\nnot being truthful, I can't help\nyou.\n(washing hands of her)\nSo your recent episodes --\ndissociation, delusions, paranoia --\nthey can all be part of a legal\ndefense.  A very good one.  Just not\nfor a cop with ambition.  If you\nstill want a career, you need me.\nAre you hearing that?\nSARAH\nYes.\nDR. BOWERS\nGood. Because your time is up.\nThank God. Sarah is right out the door.\n53   INT. PSYCHIATRIST\u2019S OFFICE, HALLWAY - DAY                     53\nSarah slips out of the office quietly, sticking to the wall.\nCraning down the hall she can glimpse ...\n54   INT. PSYCHIATRIST\u2019S OFFICE, WAITING ROOM                      54\nArt waiting for her on a couch, her escort, intense as usual.\n55   INT.

Checks her back.\nAn unfamiliar phone chirps in her bag.  Still moving, she\nfishes out Beth\u2019s usual phone, but it\u2019s the other phone that\nchirps again, the one that hasn\u2019t rung yet\n27.\nSARAH\nThe pink phone ...\nIts a TEXT: \u201c1/2 blk mre, blk BMW, get in.\u201d Sarah stops dead.\nScans the block ahead ...\nHalf way up - black BMW, tinted windows, idling.\nNow what?  Jump down another rabbit hole?  She\u2019s stuck.\nThe BMW revs it\u2019s engine.  But then she sees ... Art.\nINTERCUT:\n59   EXT. PSYCHIATRIST\u2019S OFFICE, MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY               59\nHe's on the sidewalk, casting about for Beth.  Pissed, he\npulls out his phone.\nSarah picks the devil she knows, turns quickly his way,\nslipping into Beth's \"skin\".  She switches to Beth's black\nphone and beats him to the dial.\nArt\u2019s phone rings as he\u2019s dialing.\nART\nThe fuck, Beth --?\nSARAH\nEasy.  I\u2019m right here ...\nHe sees her coming, scours, still on the line.\nAn engine roars. A backward glance.  Sarah sees the black\nBMW pulling away into traffic.\nSarah and Art hang up next to each other.  She\u2019s on the\noffensive.\nSARAH (CONT'D)\nDon\u2019t start.  I needed to be alone\nfor a minute.\nArt just shakes his head at her, deeply disappointed.\nART\nYou swore you were off the meds.\nSARAH\nI'm a mess. What do you want me to\nsay?\nART\nJesus Christ. How many pills do you\nhave to swallow to puke all over a\nDisciplinary Hearing?\n28.\nSARAH\nMore than I took.  I had to drink\nhand soap too.\nIt has that odd ring of truth that makes Art think twice.\nART\nYou did that on purpose?\nSARAH\nI was gonna screw it up, Art. I\npanicked.  I just need some more\ntime to get my head straight.\nART\nA couple days they reconvene.\nSARAH\nI'll be ready, I promise.\nART\nAnd now they fucking hate you.\nSARAH\nI'm good. I'll walk in and just stick\nto my statement.\nArt appears to soften. He reaches out to put a hand on his\npartner's shoulder. But instead he seizes the back of her\nneck and squeezes, dead fucking serious.\nART\nJust so we're clear, partner. I won't\nlet you burn my career.\nHe turns and walks away. Sarah is rattled.\n60   INT. FELIX\u2019S LOFT - DAY                                       60\nA painting underway - the vague corpse of Beth in the morgue,\nFelix working the surface.

Is that true?\nSARAH\nI don't know. Her partner's covering\nfor her somehow, but he sure doesn't\ntrust her.\nFELIX\nYeah, what\u2019s she doing with 150K in\na hidden account?\nSARAH\nI don\u2019t care. Her life is way more\nfucked up than mine.  But we can\nstill pull this off.\nFELIX\nWe have no choice now.  Vic is keening\nlike a banshee.  He wants a funeral.\nSARAH\nYou can\u2019t have a funeral.  The whole\nsad point is nobody would notice if\nI died.\nFelix chuckles, wanders the room with a jaundiced eye,\nscoffing at art, eating candies from a dish.\nFELIX\nDid I mention the bi-curious morgue\nattendant?\nSARAH\nTell Vic dead is dead and you never\nwant to see him again.\nFELIX\nWell, I need personal effects.\nSARAH\nWhat?\nFELIX (O.S.)\nYour shit, Sarah.  Objects for him\nto pine over. You could at least\nhelp with your death.\n31.\nSarah pours over Beth, trying to get a handle on her.\nSARAH\nThis girl.  She\u2019s a hardass. A control\nfreak on anti-psychotics.  I think\nher life was falling apart.\nFELIX\nThrilling, really, but can we get\nthe fucking elephant out of the room?\nHe slaps a photo of Beth right in front of her.\nFELIX (CONT'D)\nLook at her.  This could be your\nstory.\nIt\u2019s not.\nSARAH\nFELIX\nYou have to ask.\nSARAH\nNo I don\u2019t.\nFELIX\nEvery foster kid dreams of their\ndramatic lost family.

Sarah, their birth dates\nare within a month of yours.\nSARAH\nSo what?\nFELIX\nWell, what is this? Maybe your bio-\nmother was like a robo-mom who punched\nout quadruplets.\nSARAH\nThen the birthdays would be the same,\nFelix. It\u2019s just a score.  A score\ngoing out of control, okay?  It\u2019s\nway too dangerous for Kira right\nnow.  And it\u2019s too dangerous for\nyou.\nFelix sinks.  He should have known.\nFELIX\nOh.  You\u2019re gonna disappear again.\nSARAH\nJust for a bit.\nFELIX\nI\u2019m so fucking stupid.\nSARAH\nI have to, Felix. There\u2019s other weird\nshit going on.  There was a black\ncar following her ...\nFELIX\nA black car?  You must be terrified.\nHe storms off to the door.  Sarah follows.\n33.\nSARAH\nTomorrow I\u2019ll get through the bank,\nleave you some money.  I promise\nI\u2019ll be back in touch when I know\nit\u2019s safe.\nFELIX\nKeep your money.  Okay?
