And I can't breathe\n\n4 A.M\nAnd I was sleeping, but the phone just rang\n*ring*\n\"Hello?\"\nDead air\nAnd someone breathing who's up to something\n\nI'll leave and let you go\nAnd though you're moving a little too slow\nI'll even let you know\nYou did the right thing\nYou might also like*ring*\n\"Hello?\"Embed"
