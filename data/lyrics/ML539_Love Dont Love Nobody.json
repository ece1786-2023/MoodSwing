Oh no!\nIt takes a fool to learn\nWhen you're down and out, shout about it\nThat love don't love no more\nTell the world, oooh babe\nNo more\nOh, babe\nIt takes a fool to learn\nGotta be more careful about myself\nThat love don't love nobody\nIt takes a fool to learn\nWhoa baby, took me a long time to learn, to learn, well\nYou might also likeThat love don't love no one\nIt takes a fool to learn\nI was a fool, you were a fool\nThat love don't love nobody\nNow we got love, we need love\nIt takes a fool to learnEmbed"
