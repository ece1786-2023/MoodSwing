I'm coming up only to hold you under
I'm coming up only to show you're wrong
And to know you is hard, we wonder
To know you all wrong, we won

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Really too late to call so we wait for
Morning to wake you is all we got
And to know me as hardly golden
Is to know me all wrong, they warn

[Chorus]
At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral
At every occasion once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
At every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral

[Bridge]
I'm coming up only to show you down for
And coming up only to show you're wrong
To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
For they don't have trees to hang upon

[Chorus]
At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral
At every occasion once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
At every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral

[Bridge]
I'm coming up only to show you down for
And coming up only to show you're wrong
To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
For they don't have trees to hang upon
