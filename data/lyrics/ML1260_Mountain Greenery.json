 "lyrics": "1 ContributorMountain Greenery LyricsOn the first of May, it is moving day\nSpring is here, so blow your job\nThrow your job away\n\nNow's the time to trust to your wanderlust\nIn the city's dust you wait, must you wait\nJust you wait\n\nIn our mountain greenery\nWhere God paints the scenery\nJust two crazy people together\n\nWhile you love your lover\nLet blue skies be your coverlet\nWhen it rains, we'll laugh at the weather\n\nAnd if you're good\nI'll search for wood\nSo you can cook while I stand looking\n\nBeans could get no keener\nReception in a beanery\nBless our mountain greenery home\n\nMosquitoes here\nWon't bite you dear\nWell, I'll let them sting me on the finger\nYou might also likeWe could find no cleaner retreat\nFrom life's machinery\nBless our mountain greenery home\nOur mountain greenery homeEmbed"
