2 ContributorsCottage in Negril Lyrics[Intro]
Uh oh oh
Yeah

[Chorus]
From a little cottage in Negril
I wrote these lines to you
From a little cottage in Negril
I realized I love you still

[Verse 1]
From a little cottage on the hill
Way down west in Negril
This man sit
He sit, pining for your love
Gee wee, I miss you
How my lips wanna kiss you
I called you on the phone
To my suprise you were not home

[Chorus]
But, from a little cottage in Negril
I wrote these lines to you, yeah
From a little cottage in Negril
I realized I love you still
You might also like[Verse 2]
Brothers getting jade
Some sniffing cocaine
Some getting high
Licking sinsemilla pie
Some get high
Jamming sinsemilla cake
Then go west to watch sunset at Rick's Cafe

[Chorus]
But, from a little cottage in Negril
I wrote these lines to you
From a little cottage in Negril
I realized I love you still

[Musical Interlude]
I love you
I love you, baby
Oh yeah
Yeah aye eeh yeah

[Verse 3]
Brothers getting jade
Some hooked cocaine
Some getting high
Licking on the collie pie
Some get high
Jamming sinsemilla cake
Then go west to watch sunset at the Rick's Cafe
[Chorus]
But, from a little cottage in Negril
I wrote these lines to you
Oh
From a little cottage in Negril
I realized I love you still

[Outro]
Oh ooh oh
From a little cottage in Negril
I wrote these lines to you, yeah
From a little cottage in Negril
I realized I love you stillEmbed
