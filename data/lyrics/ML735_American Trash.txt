5 ContributorsAmerican Trash Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got this planet in my hands
You know I'll waste it if I can
Come on let's give it a twist
And if it all turns to shit
Oh wait, let's try that again
My life's too short to have a plan
Here, let me help you understand
First take this drink and this pill
Relax your mind and be still
Let's find out who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I

[Chorus]
I'm just American trash
Stupid American trash
I'm just American (trash)
Stupid American trash

[Verse 2]
I've got this planet in my hands
Yeah, I'll try to save it if I can
I'm satisfied with myself
Don't care for anyone else
I'm so united when I stand
I get my facts from the TV
Believe in everything I read
It's such an ignorant bliss
When the whole fucking world wants to be like me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I

[Chorus]
I'm just American (trash)
Stupid American trash
I'm just American (trash)
Stupid American trash
I'm just American

[Bridge]
And everyone's shutting down
The people are so worn out
Wake up, the dream is over
Everyone's shutting down
The people are so worn out
Wake up, the dream is over
Wake up, the dream is over
('Cause I) Wake up

[Chorus]
I'm just American (trash)
Stupid American trash
I'm just American (trash)
Stupid American trash
I'm just American
