5 ContributorsSimple X Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some people wake up on Monday mornings
Barring maelstroms and red flare warnings
With no explosions and no surprises
Perform a series of exercises

[Bridge]
Hold your fire
Take your place around an open fire

[Chorus]
Before your neurons declare a crisis
Before your trace Serotonin rises
Before you're reading your coffee grounds
And before a pundit could make a sound
And before you're reading your list of vices
Perform the simplest exercises

[Verse 2]
So here we are at the end, the war is over
There's nothing left to defend, no cliffs of Dover
So let us put down our pens and this concludes our test
Our minds are scattered about from hell to breakfast

[Bridge]
