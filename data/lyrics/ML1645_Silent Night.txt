6 ContributorsSilent Night Lyrics[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra, Choir]
Silent night (Silent night), holy night (Holy night)
All is calm (All is calm), all is bright (All is bright)
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2: Frank Sinatra, Choir]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia (Alleluia)
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is bornYou might also likeEmbed
