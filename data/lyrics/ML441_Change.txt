If I could change the way I live my life today
I wouldn't change a single thing
'Cause if I change my world into another place
I wouldn't see your smiling face

Honey, don't you worry
There's nothing to worry for
'Cause if I didn't love you I wouldn't be here now
And if I didn't want you
I would have turned around by now

You've got to believe me, babe
Believe that I love you so
'Cause if I didn't love you, I would have turned around
And if I didn't want you
Then I would want you out

This love, this love has filled me up
Ooh, my love, I'll never give you up
'Cause I'll always want your love

If I could change the way I live my life today
I wouldn't change a single thing
'Cause if I change my world into another place
I wouldn't see your smiling face
You might also likeBelieving is the answer, the answer to all your fears
When I first said I loved you, I went in for the kill
Now when I say I love you, I mean I always will

This love, this love has filled me up
Ooh, my love, I'll never give you up
'Cause I'll always want your love

If I could change the way I live my life today
I wouldn't change a single thing
'Cause if I change my world into another place
I wouldn't see your smiling face

This love, this love has filled me up
Ooh, my love, I'll never give you up
'Cause I'll always want your love

If I could change (change) the way (way) I live my life today
I wouldn't change a single thing
'Cause if I change (change) my world (world) into another place
I wouldn't see your smiling faceEmbed
