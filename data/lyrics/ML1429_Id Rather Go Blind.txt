27 ContributorsIâ€™d Rather Go Blind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Something told me it was over (Yeah)
When I saw you and her talkin'
Something deep down in my soul said, "Cry, girl" (Cry, cry)
When I saw you and that girl walkin' around, ooh

[Chorus]
I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me, child, no, ooh
So, you see, I love you so much that I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't wanna be free, no, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I was just, I was just, I was just sittin' here thinkin'
Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When a reflection in a glass that I held to my lips, now, baby (Yeah, yeah)
Revealed these tears that are on my face, ooh

[Chorus]
And, baby, and, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind, boy (Baby, baby, baby)
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, yeah
And, baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind, boy (Baby, baby, baby)
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, babyYou might also like6Embed
