(Yeah)\nDo I make your heart beat like an 808 drum? (Yeah)\nIs my love your drug? (Yeah)\nYour drug (Yeah)\nHuh, your drug (Yeah)\nHuh, your drug (Yeah)\nIs my love your drug? (Yeah)\n[Chorus]\nBecause your love, your love, your love is my drug\nYour love, your love, your love\nI said your love, your love, your love is my drug\nYour love, your love, your love\nBecause your love, your love, your love is my drug (Ooh-woah)\nYour love, your love, your love (Ooh-woah)\nI said your love, your love, your love is my drug (Ooh-woah)\nYour love, your love, your love (Ooh-woah)\n\n[Outro]\nHey\nHey, so...\nYour love, your love, your love, your love, is my drug\nI like your beard22Embed"
