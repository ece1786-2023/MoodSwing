 "lyrics": "1 ContributorMerry Christmas LyricsThere's a little girl trembling on a cold December morn\nCrying for mama's arms\nAt an orphanage just outside a little China town\nWhere the forgotten are\n\nBut half a world away I hang the stockings by the fire\nAnd dream about the day when I can finally call you mine\n\nIt's Christmas time again but you're not home\nYour family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone\nSo tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms\nAnd tell you from my heart\nI wish you Merry Christmas\n\nAs I hang the tinsel on the tree and watch the twinkling lights\nI'm warmed by the fire's glow\nOutside the children tumble in the wonderland of white\nAnd make angels in the snow\n\nBut half a world away you try your best to fight the tears\nAnd hope that Heaven's Angels come to carry you here\n\nIt's Christmas time again but you're not home\nYour family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone\nSo tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms\nAnd tell you from my heart\nI wish you Merry Christmas\nYou might also likeChristmas is the time we celebrate the Holy Child\nAnd we celebrate His perfect gift of love\nHe came to Earth to give His life and prepare a place for us\nSo we could have a home with Him above\n\nIt's Christmas time again and now you're home\nYour family is here so you will never be alone\nSo tonight before you go to sleep, I'll hold you in my arms\nAnd tell you from my heart\nI'll tell you from my heart\nI wish you Merry Christmas\n\n(empty space -- hidden track)\n\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas\nAnd a Happy New Year\n\nGood tidings we bring to you and your kin;\nGood tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas\nAnd a Happy New Year\nGood tidings we bring to you and your kin;\nGood tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas\nWe wish you a Merry Christmas\nAnd a Happy New YearEmbed"
