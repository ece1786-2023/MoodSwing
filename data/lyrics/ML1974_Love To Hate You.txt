12 ContributorsLove to Hate You Lyrics[Intro]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I'm crazy flowing over with ideas
A thousand ways to woo a lover so sincere
Love and hate, what a beautiful combination
Sending shivers up and down my spine

[Verse 2]
For every Casanova that appears
My sense of hesitation disappears
Love and hate, what a beautiful combination
Sending shivers up and down my spine

[Pre-Chorus]
And the lovers that you sent for me
Didn't come with any satisfaction guarantee
So I return them to the sender
And the note attached will read
You might also like[Chorus]
How I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you

[Verse 3]
Oh, you really still expect me to believe
Every single letter I receive
Sorry what a shameful situation
Sending shivers up and down my spine

[Verse 4]
Ooh, I like to read murder mystery
I like to know the killer isn't me
Love and hate, what a beautiful combination
Sending shivers make me quiver
Feel it slither up and down my spine

[Pre-Chorus]
And the lovers that you sent for me
Didn't come with any satisfaction guarantee
So I return them to the sender
And the note attached will read

[Chorus]
How I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you
[Pre-Chorus]
And the lovers that you sent for me
Didn't come with any satisfaction guarantee
So I return them to the sender
And the note attached will read

How I love to hate you
I love to hate you

And the lovers that you sent for me
Didn't come with any satisfaction guarantee
So I return them to the sender
And the note attached will read

[Outro]
How I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you2Embed
