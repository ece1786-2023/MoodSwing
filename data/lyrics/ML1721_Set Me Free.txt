Set me free, little girl
All you gotta do is set me free, little girl
You know you can do it if you try
All you gotta do is set me free, free
Free
Set me free, little girl
All you gotta do is set me free, little girl
You know you can do it if you try
All you gotta do is set me free, free
Free, free

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want no one
If I can't have you to myself
I don't need nobody else
So if I can't have you to myself

[Chorus]
Set me free
Set me free

[Verse]
Oh set me free, little girl
All you gotta do is set me free, little girl
You know you can do it if you try
All you gotta do is set me free, free
Free, free

Oh set me free, little girl
All you gotta do is set me free, little girl
You know you can do it if you try
All you gotta do is set me free, free
