 "lyrics": "8 ContributorsHere Sometimes LyricsA little girl above the fireplace\nOnly air flying emotionless\nRing the bells for she could keep flying\nThis is me, completely me\n\nEnd of day, we watched the sun go down\nBut I can see, you're like a firework\nYou wanna save me, people will save me\nBut this is you, completely you\n\nNow it's day but I am dreaming\nA man walks by, I want to be his wife\nI'm only here sometimes\nUnder the tree of life\nI'm only good sometimes\nTaking my time to go home\n\nLike a candle wasted from burning\nI got shoes tired from walking\nCalling out your name, my lips keep failing\nThey have now forgot to sing\n\nNow it's day but I am dreaming\nA man walks by, I want to be his wife\nI'm only here sometimes\nUnder the tree of life\nI'm only good sometimes\nTaking my time to go home\nSee Blonde Redhead LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also likeI'm only here sometimes\nUnder the tree of life\nI'm only good sometimes\nTaking my time to go home\n\nI'm only here sometimes\nUnder the tree of life\nI'm only here sometimes\nTaking my time to go homeEmbed"
