It's never enough\nIt's never enough until your heart stops beating\nThe deeper you get, the sweeter the pain\nDon't give up the game until your heart stops beating\nUntil your heart\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou call me on the phone, you left me all alone\nAll I get from you is shellshock\nAnother day goes by and all I do is cry\nAll I get from you is shellshock\nI'd tell the world and save my soul\nBut rain falls down and I feel cold\nA cold that sleeps within my heart\nIt tears the Earth and Sun apart\nBut that's the way (that\u2019s the way) I can win (ah)\nA victim of (that\u2019s the way) your evil sin (ah)\nYou've lost the hold (that\u2019s the way) you've had on me (ah)\nBy causing the changes that you never see\nSee New Order LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like[Chorus]\nHold on! It's never enough\nIt's never enough until your heart stops beating\nThe deeper you get, the sweeter the pain\nDon't give up the game until your heart stops beating\nOn! It's never enough\nIt's never enough until your heart stops beating\nThe deeper you get, the sweeter the pain\nDon't give up the game until your heart stops beating\nOn!\nUntil your heart\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen we walk through open doorways\nCounting time in one or more ways\nWe can't find our peace of mind\nAnd life becomes a life of crime\nAnd that's the day (that\u2019s the way) I call your name (ah)\nI came to you, (that\u2019s the way) I called in vain (ah)\nYou lost the faith (that\u2019s the way) within your heart (ah)\nThe fire in your soul from the end to the start\n\n[Chorus]\nHold on! It's never enough\nIt's never enough until your heart stops beating\nThe deeper you get, the sweeter the pain\nDon't give up the game until your heart stops beating\nOn!\nUntil your heart, until your heart\nThat\u2019s the way\n\n[Verse 3]\nI've been good and I've been bad\nBut common sense I've never had\nNo matter how I try and try\nI hide the truth behind a lie\nBut that's the way (that\u2019s the way) that I can win (ah)\nA victim of (that\u2019s the way) your evil sin (ah)\nYou lost the faith (that\u2019s the way) within your heart (ah)\nThe fire in your soul from the end to the start\n\n[Chorus]\nHold on!
