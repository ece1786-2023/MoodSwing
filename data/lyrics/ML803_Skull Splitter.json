 "lyrics": "2 ContributorsNuclear Torment LyricsApocalyptic doom is near, casting death's spell\nNo one can escape, the imminent nuclear hell\nWarmongers scheme unfolding divine vision\nKill the enemy, through nuclear detonation\nReligious insanity, manifesting through terror\nOpening the gates, apparition of horror\nJetblack demons leave their subterranean caves\nHeading for destruction, condemn many to the graves\nWarheads hit the Earth, eclipse of mass death\nAnnihilating rage arrives burning reaper's breath\nThe worlds you knew is gone, a wasteland ever since\n\nThe atomic blast, caused total destruction\nThousands where killed, cities where laid to waste\nMerciless genocide, wiped out civilization\nThe land was reigned, by famine, war and plague\nPredator and prey, nature's laws prevail\nHoly commandments, their ignorance revealed\nMan thrown back, into a state of barbarism\nCruel existence for those that had remain\n\nKill or be killed\nSlay or be slain\nYour destiny lies\nIn the grave\nYou might also likeEat or be eaten\nRape or be raped\nYour destiny lies\nIn the grave\n\nThose who didn't die, lived by brutal violence\nTo hunt and kill, only survival in their minds\nFamine force some to turn to ancient evils\nCannibal lust, antropophagious rites\nSlay the weak, and cut them into pieces\nEat their remains, make necklaces from their bones\nConsume their heart, so you will take their spirit\nBreak their skulls an splatter their blood on stones\n\nKill or be killed\nSlay or be slain\nYour destiny lies\nIn the grave\n\nEat or be eaten\nRape or be raped\nYour destiny lies\nIn the grave\n\nNuclear torment\nTotal annihilation\nNuclear torment\nRelease through detonation\nNuclear torment\nUnholy revelation\nNuclear torment\nThe gods eradicated\n\nOnly the strongest, will rule in this new Eden\nThey take the women, the riches and the slaves\nCruelty and torture to those who are defeated\nDisplay supremacy, take them body and soul\nNo god rules here, in this atomic desolation\nThose who still pray, will learn it is in vain\nMan's civilization was nothing but the surface\nBelow the skin, the beast, always remains!Embed"
