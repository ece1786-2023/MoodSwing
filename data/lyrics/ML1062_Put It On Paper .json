 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsPut It on Paper LyricsWhen my soul was lost\nThere was no one around\nBut you were there for me\nWhen the rain came down\nInto every sunny day\nA little rain must fall\nAnd without the rain upon us\nWould we ever grow\nLike so many others I was too afraid of change\n'Till I put my trust in you\nYou took away my pain\n\nI allowed my fears to take hold of me\nHad nowhere to run 'cause\nI was too deep\nLet the rain fall down on me\nLet the rain fall down on me\nLet the rain fall down on me\nLet the rain fall down on me\n\nWaited for a better day that seems so far away\nEven though my faith was shaky, you showed me the way\nI was searching for a way that I could make it through\nFigured out what I did wrong\nI didn't trust in you\nYou might also likeI allowed my fears to take hold of me\nHad nowhere to run 'cause\nI was too deep\nLet the rain fall down on me\nLet the rain fall down on me\nLet the rain fall down on me\nLet the rain fall down on me\n\nDoesn't really matter how hard the rain is gonna fall\n'Cause through any weather, there's someone I can call\nStorm clouds may rise\nStrong winds may blow\nYou said you'd never leave me anywhere I go\n\nI allowed my fears to take hold of me\nHad nowhere to run 'cause\nI was too deep\nLet the rain fall down on me\nLet the rain fall down on me\nLet the rain fall down on me\nLet the rain fall down on meEmbed"
