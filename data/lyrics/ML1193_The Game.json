You don't wanna play me\nI am control, no way you can change me\nI am heavy debt, no way you can pay me\nI am the pain, and I know you can't take me\n\n[Verse]\nLook over your shoulder, ready to run\nLike a good little bitch from a smoking gun\nI am the game, and I make the rules\nSo move on out or you can die like a fool\nTry to figure out what my move\u2019s gonna be\nCome on over sucker, why don\u2019t you ask me?\nDon't you forget, there's a price you can pay\n'Cause I am the game, and I want to play\n\n[Break]\nIt's time to play the game\nHahahahahahahahaha\nTime to play the game\nYou might also like[Chorus 2]\nIt's all about the game, and how you play it\nIt's all about control, and if you can take it\nIt's all about your debt, and if you can pay it\nIt's all about the pain, and who's gonna make it\nI am the game. You don't wanna play me\nI am control, there's no way you can change me\nI am your debt, they know you can't pay me\nI am your pain, and I know you can't take me\n\n[Bridge]\nPlay the game, you're gonna be the same\nYou're gonna change your name\nYou're gonna die in flames\nHahahahahahaha\nTime to play the game\nIt's time to play the game\n\n[Outro]\nIt's time to play the game\nIt's time to play the game\nHahahahahahaha\nTime to play the game\nHahahahahaha1Embed"
