We do not know\n\n[Verse 2]\nNew Wave tried to destroy The Metal\nBut The Metal had its way\nGrunge then tried to dethrone The Metal\nBut Metal was in the way\nPunk Rock tried to destroy The Metal\nBut Metal was much too strong\nTechno tried to defile The Metal\nBut Techno was proven wrong\nYeah\nSee Tenacious D LiveGet tickets as low as $74You might also like[Outro]\nMetal\nIt comes from Hell18Embed"
