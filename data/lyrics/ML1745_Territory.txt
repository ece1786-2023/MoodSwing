16 ContributorsTerritory Lyrics[Verse 1]
Unknown man speaks to the world
Sucking your trust, a trap in every word

[Chorus]
War for territory
War for territory

[Verse 2]
Choice control behind propaganda
Poor information to manage your anger

[Chorus]
War for territory
War for territory

[Bridge]
Dictator's speech blasting off your life
Rule to kill the urge, dumb asshole's speech

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Years of fighting, teaching my son
To believe in that man, racist human being
Racist ground will live, shame and regret
Of the pride you've once possessed
