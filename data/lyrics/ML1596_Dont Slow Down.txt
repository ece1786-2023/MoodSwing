2 ContributorsDon’t Slow Down LyricsLocked knees, no keys, Brooklyn, Grand Street
Four flights, late nights, black socks, white dice
Ten pounds, loud sounds, turned up, tied
And bound

[Chorus]
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down

(Don't slow down) Fire escapes sunny
(Don't slow down) Butter and honey
(Don't slow down) Iron and money
Don't slow down

(Don't slow down) Pen versus pencil
(Don't slow down) I don't make the rules
(Don't slow down) Physical mental
Don't slow down

[Chorus]
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
You might also likeGardens and trashcans
Hoodies and chuck-t's
Arms, fingers, and hands
Don't slow down

(Don't slow down) I'm feeling restless
(Don't slow down) Summons and sentence
(Don't slow down) We've made some messes
Don't slow down

[Chorus]
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
Don't slow downEmbed
