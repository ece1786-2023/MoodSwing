5 ContributorsDirty Black Summer Lyrics[Verse 1]
No summer in the winter time
Will keep you warm like a funeral pyre
And nothing like an August night
Drenched in your loving

[Chorus]
I got a dirty black summer, ooh
Yeah, my dirty black summer, ooh
Yeah, gimme black summer, ooh
Yeah, my dirty black summer, ooh

[Verse 2]
And nothing in the coolest light
Can stop the walking out across the line
No holding back the summer night
I got a feeling

[Chorus]
It's just a dirty black summer
Oh whoa, whoa ho
A black summertime
Oh, whoa, whoa
Dirty black summer, ooh
Yeah, my dirty black summer, ooh
Yeah, gimme black summer, ooh
Yeah, my dirty black summer
Hey, come on baby
Dirty black summer, ooh
Yeah, my dirty black summer, ooh
Come on, gimme black summertime
Yeah, my dirty black summer, ooh

No summer in the winter time
Will keep you warm like a funeral pyre
Nothing drips like an August night

I'm on a dirty black summer
Oh whoa, whoa
Oh, my summertime
Oh whoa, whoa
Yeah, my summertime
Oh whoa, whoa
Oh, my summertime
Oh whoa whoa ho
My dirty black summer, ooh
