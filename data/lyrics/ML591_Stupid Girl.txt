20 ContributorsStupid Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
You pretend you're high
Pretend you're bored
Pretend you're anything
Just to be adored
And what you need
Is what you get
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in faith
Don't believe in anything
That you can't break

[Chorus 1]
You stupid girl (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
All you had, you wasted (Ah)
All you had, you wasted (Ah)

[Verse 2]
What drives you on (drives you on)
Can drive you mad (drive you mad)
A million lies to sell yourself
Is all you ever had
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't believe in love
Don't believe in hate
Don't believe in anything
That you can't waste

[Chorus 2]
You stupid girl (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
Can't believe you fake it (Ah)
Can't believe you fake it (Ah)
[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in pain
Don't believe in anyone
That you can't tame

[Chorus 1]
You stupid girl (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
All you had, you wasted (Ah)
All you had, you wasted (Ah)
[Chorus 2]
You stupid girl (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
I can't believe you fake it (Ah)
I can't believe you fake it (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
Can't believe you fake it (Ah)
Can't believe you fake it (Ah)
