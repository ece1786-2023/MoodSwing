Was I out of my mind?\nHow could I have ever been so blind?\nI was waiting for an indication\nIt was hard to find\nDon't matter what I say, only what I do\nI never mean to do bad things to you\nSo quiet, but I finally woke up\nIf you're sad, then it's time you spoke up, too\n\n[Chorus]\nWas I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?\nHow could I have ever been so blind?\nI was waiting for an indication\nIt was hard to find\nDon't matter what I say, only what I do\nI never mean to do bad things to you\nSo quiet, but I finally woke up\nIf you're sad, then it's time you spoke up, too\nWas I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?\nHow could I have ever been so blind?\nI was waiting for an invitation\nIt was hard to find\nDon't matter what I say, only what I do\nI never mean to do bad things to you\nSo quiet, but I finally woke up\nIf you're sad, then it's time you spoke up...tooYou might also like3Embed"
