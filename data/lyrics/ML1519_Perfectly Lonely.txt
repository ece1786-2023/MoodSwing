20 ContributorsPerfectly Lonely Lyrics[Verse 1]
Had a little love, but I spread it thin
Falling in her arms and out again
Made a bad name for my game around town
Tore up my heart, and shut it down

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need

[Chorus]
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Because I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

[Verse 2]
I see friends around from time to time
When their ladies let them slip away
And when they ask me how I'm doing with mine
This is always what I say

Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need

[Chorus]
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Because I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

[Bridge]
And this is not to say
There never comes a day
I'll take my chances and start again
And when I look behind
On all my younger times
I have to thank the wrongs that led me to a love so strong

[Chorus]
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Cause I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it2Embed
