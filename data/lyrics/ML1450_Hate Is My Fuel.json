 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsHate Is My Fuel LyricsA poisoned culture - Based on lies, war & deceit\nSlaughterhouse philosophy - Cruel butchers are hard to beat\nThe law of the game - Is the law of the bloody blade\nDictated by lunacy - It's the fail death serenade\n\nWar - As the essence of a painful life\nDecay - The stream of death agony will ride\n\nHate - Hate is my fuel\nThe mob is just tool\nHate - Hate is my fuel\nI'm the lord of misrule\n\nDeath brings us together as one - The feel to be second to none\nShameful should be the gluttonous - What makes a real genius?\nErases all the treasures - Wipes out all fame, affluence and wealth\nRecognize the afterlife freedom - Won't be based on stealth\n\nWar - As the essence of a painful life\nDecay - The stream of death agony will ride\n\nHate - Hate is my fuel\nThe mob is just tool\nHate - Hate is my fuel\nI'm the lord of misrule\nYou might also likeInsanity - We do rape, wreck and then - We search for an excuse\nDecay - We all gonna rot, we're all the same on the final cruise\nModesty - Is so hard to find, is this a curse - Is this real?\nConsistency - Is a gift of life, education is the deal\n\nHate - Hate is my fuel\nThe mob is just tool\nHate - Hate is my fuel\nI'm the lord of misruleEmbed"
