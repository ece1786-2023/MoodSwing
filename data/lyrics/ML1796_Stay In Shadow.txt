So cold that you cannot
Cope with a frozen heart
I guess we blow apart
I guessed it from the start

[Chorus]
Stay in shadow
I'll run this world out
Stay in shadow
It's running out of time
Stay in shadow
I want to watch it drown
Stay in this now

[Verse 2]
Don't say because you can't
Say what we should have been
Don't show what I resent
Don't know 'cause I forget
So cruel to be so blind
Darkness was on my side
Now that you've come and gone
I know where I belong

[Chorus]
Stay in shadow
I'll run this world out
Stay in shadow
It's running out of time
Stay in shadow
I want to watch it drown
Stay in this now

Light is leaving as I watch you go
Light is leaving inside of my soul
Light is leaving as I watch you go
Light is leaving inside of my soul

[Chorus]
Stay in shadow
I'll run this world out
Stay in shadow
It's running out of time
Stay in shadow
I want to watch it drown
Stay in this now

[Outro]
I want to watch it drown
I want to watch it drownEmbed
