Go jump in the lake, go ride up the hill
Get out of this house
It's a house of your making, it's a house of ill will
Get out of this house

[Verse 2]
Go listen to Buddha, go listen to Joe
Get out of this house
If anyone asks, you tell them you don't know
Get out of this house

[Pre-Chorus]
I spent eleven long years in a hothouse zone
I spent twenty-nine more trying to get home
Well, I never got home, but I did what I did
And I got myself this house, and you can't come in, oh

[Chorus]
Get out of this house
Get out of this house

[Verse 3]
I'm the queen of my castle, I'm the king of my room
Get out, get out of this house
I got more than I need, more than I ever could use
Get out, get out of this house

I spent seventeen years tryna to save my soul
I spent twenty-three more down in the hole
Now my soul is all right, but I might get found out
And I got myself this house now, and I can't get ou-out

[Chorus]
Get out of this house
Get out of this house

[Bridge]
If I see you again, it will be in my head at the end of a cloud
If you see me again, it will be in your head telling you to get out

[Verse 4]
You act like a baby, you talk like a fool
Get out of this house
Go back to your mama, go back to high school
Get out of this house

[Verse 5]
Go jump in the lake, go jump out the door
Get out, get out of this house
I've had all I can stand, and I can't stand no more
Get out, get out of this house
Get out of this houseEmbed
