You keep calling me on the telephone
You say you're all alone, well that's real sad
And you keep leaving notes stuck on my door
Guess you're hungry for some more, girl that's too bad

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

[Verse 2]
Once there was this spider in my bed
I got caught up in her web of love and lies
She spun her chains around my heart and soul
Never to let go, oh, but I survived

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

[Bridge]
Nothin' left you can do to try and bring me 'round
'Cause everything you do just brings me down, whoa

I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yetEmbed
