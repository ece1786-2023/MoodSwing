6 ContributorsThe Refugee Lyrics[Chorus]
Wa-war, she's the refugee
I see your face, I see you staring back at me
Wa-war, she is the refugee
Her mama say one day she's gonna live in America

[Verse 1]
In the morning
She is waiting
Waiting for the ship to sail
Sail away

[Chorus]
Wa-war, her papa go to war
He gonna fight but he don't know what for
Wa-war, her papa go to war
Her mama say one day he's gonna come back from far away

[Interlude]
Woah
Go
Uh

[Bridge]
Help me
How can you help me?

In the evening
She is waiting
Waiting for her man to come
And take her by her hand
And take her to this promised land

[Chorus]
Wa-war, she's a pretty face
But at the wrong time in the wrong place
Wa-war, she's a pretty face
Her mama say one day she's gonna live in America
Yeah, America

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Wa-war, she is a refugee
She coming back, she come and keep you company
Wa-war, she is a refugee
Her mama say one day she's gonna live in America
