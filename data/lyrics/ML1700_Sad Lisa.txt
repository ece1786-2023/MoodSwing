10 ContributorsSad Lisa Lyrics[Verse 1]
She hangs her head and cries on my shirt
She must be hurt very badly
Tell me what’s making you sad, Li?
Open your door, don’t hide in the dark
You’re lost in the dark, you can trust me
’Cause you know that’s how it must be

[Refrain]
Lisa, Lisa, sad Lisa, Lisa

[Verse 2]
Her eyes like windows, tricklin' rain
Upon her pain getting deeper
Though my love wants to relieve her
She walks alone from wall to wall
Lost in a hall, she can’t hear me
Though I know she likes to be near me

[Refrain]
Lisa, Lisa, sad Lisa, Lisa

[Violin Solo]

[Verse 3]
She sits in a corner by the door
There must be more I can tell her
If she really wants me to help her
I’ll do what I can to show her the way
And maybe one day I will free her
Though I know no one can see her
