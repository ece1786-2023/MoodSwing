8 ContributorsThatâ€™s How I Escaped My Certain Fate Lyrics[Intro]
That's how I escaped my certain fate

[Verse 1]
This might be your only chance
To prove it on your own
Tulsa's not that
Tulsa's not that far

[Verse 2]
Besides, if you'd stay
I'd feel a certain guilt
Did I hold you
Did I hold you back?

[Verse 3]
Can I count on you
If I fall apart?
Yeah, if I fall a
If I fall apart

[Chorus]
That's how I escaped my certain fate
That's how I escaped my certain fate
Innocence, a novice's mistake
That's how I escaped my certain fate
That's how I escaped my certain fate
Honesty's an actor's worst mistake
That's how I escaped my certain fateYou might also likeEmbed
