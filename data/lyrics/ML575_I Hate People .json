Iggy Pop) LyricsAnother lonely night\nI think if I'm lucky i'll get into a fight\nI hate everything I see\nIt's a different city with the same old scene\nA waste of space\nThen what a suprise\nThrough the dull conversations and glazed over eyes\nThere you were in all your glory\nI could tell that you wouldn't bore me\n\nOh I\nI hate people\nBut I\nI like you\nOh I\nI hate people\nAnd you\nYou do too\n\nI was walking\nAround wanting to die\nThought I wouldn't make it through the night if I try\nBut I saw you standing there\nIn your torn leather jacket and dark brown hair\nYou were different\nFrom all the rest\nMy eyes saw only yours and that big mess\nAs I pushed past the people to get to you\nI saw in your eyes that you already knew\nYou might also likeOh I\nI hate people\nBut I\nI like you\nOh I\nI hate people\nAnd you\nYou do too\n\nI thought that we could get together\nI thought that we could have some fun\nJust the two of us\nAlone together\nHating everyone!\n\nOh I\nI hate people\nBut I\nI like you\nOh I\nI hate people\nAnd you\nYou do too1Embed"
