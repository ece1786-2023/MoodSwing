2 ContributorsKing Of Nothing LyricsIt was gone before you ever had a chance
Lost forever in your disapproving glance

I see your face
It's twisted with shock
Falling from grace
You deserve what you got

The ice surrounds you now

You can't pretend
All that you want
I've seen the pain
And all the evil you brought

Quit your fucking crying
And swallow all your pills
Your not the only one
With the urge to kill
Grab the dusty bottle
And let the liquor spill
Devoid of life
Death is your final thrill

Bloodshot eyes
Can see right through the selfish lies
Search forever for a fix that keeps you high
You might also likeI see your face
It's twisted with shock
Falling from grace
You deserve what you got

My hands around your throat

You can't pretend
All that you want
I've seen the pain
And all the evil you brought

I am the king of nothing
Over emptiness I reign
Drown the sorrow
Wash away the painEmbed
