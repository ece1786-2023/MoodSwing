16 ContributorsMbuzi (Freestyle) Lyrics[Intro: Mgarimbe, Robert Marawa, Benni McCarthy]
In the meantime-
In the meantime-
In the meantime, meantime, meantime (Oh shit, Sister Bethina)
Marawa Sports Worldwide (Rewind the tape)
Benni McCarthy, thank you so much, look forward to seeing you
Robert Marawa, good speaking to you as always my brother, and you’re my friend, my man, so give me a call when you’re, when you’ve got a minute or so and we keep in touch
Alright, thank you so much, I'll phone you
(Sister Bethina)

[Verse 1: AKA]
Ooh ah, fresh out the bed
New Jordan 3s, got a spring in my step
Do my devotion and drop in a X
Hit thе Off-ramp and go right to the bag
This shit is pendulum motion, it swings
I just sit back and let God do his thing
Tint in my windows so you can't see in
I closе the circle, we out for revenge
I am a fan of ‘Piano but I cannot bend over backwards to fit in with trends
Tell me what happened with Mega?
Go platinum, I’d rather sell nothing, than lie to my fans
This ain’t a costume, I zip up and wear
Jesus is closer and the devil is near
Just got a text that say 150k, 25th of December, I told them "No way", uh
Family first is the wave
MTV List only sharpened the blade
Not even once did they put me first place
Tragedy happened, has tracks under caption
Gave me the idea to put noose on my neck
Thought of my daughter, I had to persist
Lawyers on lawyers, they cost me a fortune
They loya’ed, they loya'ed, put price on my head (Huh)
And I mean full disrespect
DJ's, y’all just stand behind the decks (Huh)
Sacrificed, blood, sweat and tears (Huh)
Too many treacherous spins (Mhm)
Influencers, oh yeah
They think they Mega, they Mega
Okay you got a few dancers, you think you Kamo Mphela
Shit!
You might also like[Chorus: AKA]
Comin’ in, comin’ in hot (Hot)
Comin’ in hot kaMbuzi
You cannot sit in my spot (Huh, ah yeah)
You cannot block this muthi (Sheesh)
Pyramid, pyramid rocks (Ooh)
I'm comin’up top, Mbuzi
I'm cut from a different cloth
Material girl don’t sue me

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up
Whenever I win they whisper
Whenever I slip it’s Christmas
Whenever I sip it’s Crystal
Guapin' my lawyer, watchin' for loyo
On my Dior, Christian
Let’s go!

[Verse 2: AKA]
Oh yeah
Ooh ah, I am the best
Record and stay up till the AMs
Tweetin' his fans to blow smoke up his ass
Legacy, Megacy, that’s all that matters
We dont give a fuck about the material
As long as I got some food in the fridge
Roof over my head
These awards are just some glorified pieces of metal
What the fuck did it ever do for me
Besides give me more stress than you ever imagined?
Everything I thought was bigger than me was revealed to be cap
This a new era, Hansie Cronje
Came face-to-face with the devil and national treasure protea
I hit that bullshit for six, it's a test
All that I ever wanted was money for retros
Now everytime that I spit it's a swish
Kick coulda told you I'm cool as my wrist
Kept our composure, you thought we was dead?
150k, that don’t include the Jet
Nostra my Nosa, that's after Gemelli
I came for the jam or the eggs, Benedict
Thali Gianni, if you smoke for the sec
That bubbly so strong, watch out for the steps
Go!
[Chorus: AKA]
Comin’ in, comin’ in hot (Yo)
Comin’ in hot kaMbuzi
You cannot sit in my spot (No-no)
You cannot block this muthi
Pyramid, pyramid rocks
I'm comin’up top, Mbuzi
I'm cut from a different cloth, material girl don’t sue me

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up
Whenever I win they whisper
Whenever I slip it’s Christmas
Whenever I sip it’s Crystal
Guapin' my lawyer, watchin' for loyo
On my Dior, it's Christian
Let’s go, yeah!

[Verse 3: Thato Saul]
Yeah
Ase thapelo fela ke tlatsa ka s'thito le madi (Madi)
Young nigga Big Steppa o e lwile
Young nigga e ba mmitsa a sebari
Young nigga Big Steppa ba thomile ho mona mo Tau, Ramokhopa
O ka mona, o ka tshuma leplaki
Ke circle le nou ba ka kathi (Kathi)
Rich man ish e mo jumpile lezwi
O no nkare n'o dlaliwa khathi (Yeah)
Sally o kao botsa dipaki (Yeah)
Left-hand man o phela a feele nqondo tse pila fela
Le right-hand a se bari, (Yeah)
Nthwe ke o botsang keo tshwara unit ya ho fa plane
Now a ka tlhatsa le thari (Thari)
40 bm mo piano ngwana eg.  can I byoring
Which means can I clothe the Bee Gees
Ba tla o botsa ka album ya ngwaga, ke mbuzi, ka ngwala (Ngwala)
Mo strateng dibeef ha di ya pala (Pala)
I need a record with A.K.A
But I also need to remove the A that comes after the K
'Cause I witnessed the bit-ness of the bodies decay
I got fitness, I'm witness
Nobody’s relay, runna race ke le one (One)
26th birthday phone call e le tsene achuz ba mmethile ka gunne (Gun)
Mengwaga mara why o shiya straata botlhoko?
Dankie Rap, eng fele le planne
Se seholo k'o tšwella pele
Ya ka e clocka ha re tsentsa day-to-day e tswane le mabane (Bane)
Look at the come up, I'm clockin’ a come up
Ba banšhi ba e lwela a ke hane
Top dog ke Byor, hao lebale
[Chorus: AKA]
Comin’ in, comin’ in hot (Yo)
Comin’ in hot kaMbuzi
You cannot sit in my spot (No-no)
You cannot block this muthi
Pyramid, pyramid rocks
I'm comin’up top, Mbuzi
I'm cut from a different cloth, material girl don’t sue me

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up
Whenever I win they whisper
Whenever I sleep it's Christmas
Whenever I sip it's crystal
Guapin' my lawyer, watchin' for loyo
On my Dior, it's Christian

[Outro: AKA]
I protect myself with scripture
Take your best shot with the witchcraftEmbed
