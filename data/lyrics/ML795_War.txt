2 ContributorsWar Lyrics[Chorus]
War
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
War
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing

[Verse 1]
War, it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
Friend only to the undertaker
War means tears
To thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go off to fight
And their daughters lose their lives in

[Chorus]
War
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
War
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing

[Verse 2]

The news of war, it breaks my heart and closed my mind
War has laid waste to a whole generation
Induction then destruction
And who wants to die in a

War
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Tell me, war
What is it good for?
Ask yourself this question

[Bridge]
Oh, peace, love and understanding
Tell me, is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord, Lord, Lord there's got to be a better way

[Chorus]
War
What is it good for?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
War
What is it good for? What is it good for?

[Refrain]
What is it good for? What is it good for?
What is it good for? What is it good for?
What is it good for? What is it good for?
What is it good for? What is it good for?
[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Lord, can you tell me now
There's got to be a better wayEmbed
