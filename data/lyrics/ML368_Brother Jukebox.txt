Brother jukebox, sister wine
Mother freedom, father of time
Since she left me by myself
You're the only family I've got left

[Verse 1]
I go down to that same old caf√©
Where I try to wash my troubles away
I'm still down and I'm still all alone
But it beats staying home all night long

[Chorus]
Brother jukebox, sister wine
Mother freedom, father of time
Since she left me by myself
You're the only family I've got left

[Verse 2]
I go home and I climb that old stairway
And I tell myself "tomorrow's a new day"
But I know I'll just go out again
And spend my time with my new next-of-kin

[Chorus]
Brother jukebox, sister wine
Mother freedom, father of time
Since she left me by myself
You're the only family I've got left
You might also like[Chorus]
Brother jukebox, sister wine
Mother freedom, father of time
Since she left me by myself
You're the only family I've got left
