Lyrics[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]\nDark is the light, the man you fight with all your prayers, incantations\nRunning away, a trivial day of judgment and deliverance\nTo whom was sold this bounty soul, a gentile or a priest?\nWho victored over the Seljuks when the holy land was taken?\n\n[Chorus: Serj Tankian]\nWe will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens\nWe will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens\n\n[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]\nWas it the riches of the land, powers of bright darkness\nThat lead the nobles to the East to fight the heathens\n\n[Chorus: Serj Tankian]\nWe will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens\nWe will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nNow, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens\nNow, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens\n\n[Bridge: Serj Tankian]\nWe must call upon our bright darkness\nBeliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked\nOne was written on the sword\nFor you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it\nNo International security, no call of the righteous man\nNeeds a reason to kill a man, history teaches us so\nThe reason he must attain must be approved by his God\nHis child, partisan brother of war\nSee System Of A Down LiveGet tickets as low as $525You might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nOf war, we don't speak anymore\nOf war, we don't speak anymore\nOf war, we don't speak anymore\nOf war, we don't speak anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nWe will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens\nWe will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens\n\n[Outro]\nNow, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens\nNow, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens5Embed"
