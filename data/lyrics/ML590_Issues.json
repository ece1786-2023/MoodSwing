(They choke me like a noose)\nIssues! (They choke me like a noose)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe hounds of Hell, they cry\nThat's how they get to me\nInject my head with lies\nThe pain's astonishing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLike a brick or a stone\nSlowly crushing my bones\nSendin' me to my grave\nAnd it's just a fake\nThis life that I made\nI'm going insane\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThese issues pin me to the floor\nThese issues are my overlord\nI feel so dominated\nThese issues, they choke me like a noose\nIssues! (They choke me like a noose)\nIssues! (They choke me like a noose)\nIssues!\nIssues! (They choke me like a noose)\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nThese issues pin me to the floor\nThese issues are my overlord\nI feel so dominated\nThese issues, they choke me like a noose\nIssues! (They choke me like a noose)\nIssues! (They choke me like a noose)\nIssues! (They choke me like a noose)\nIssues!\nThey choke me like a nooseEmbed"
