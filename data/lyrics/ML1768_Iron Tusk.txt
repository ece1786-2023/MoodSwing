12 ContributorsIron Tusk LyricsStraight line
Feel it burst liver and lung
Long and strong
'Til she spills her black blood

Center down
Vast the head, body and tail
Shatter life
Physeter catodon

Culture vulture
Elephant graveyard

[Instrumental Break]

Culture vulture
Engage monster
Wreaking vengeance
Assault with all martial rage

Sail onYou might also like2Embed
