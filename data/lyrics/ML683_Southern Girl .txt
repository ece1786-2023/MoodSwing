3 ContributorsSouthern Girl Lyrics[Verse 1: Frankie Beverly]
Southern girl, don't you know
You're good to me and I dig you so
I wouldn't be right here if you hadn't been right there
I wanna talk to you
Southern girl, you're the one
Lots of lovin', lots of fun
The tenderness you give me I wanna take it everywhere, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
I wasn't happy, not at all, no
You were the first to hear my call
Your hospitality shows me that you care
Get up, get up, get up, woo

[Verse 2: Frankie Beverly]
Below the Mason-Dixon Line
Down there where the girls are fine, ha ha
Sure know how to treat me, you just make me feel so good, yeah, woo
Southern girl, here's to you
No one can do it like you do, oh no
Girl, you be so sweet, I just always knew you would
Girl, you love me from the start, alright
From the bottom of your heart
Came along and heard my song

[Chorus: Maze, Frankie Beverly]
Southern girl
(Get down, get down, get down, pretty mama, now)
Southern girl
(I wanna tell you somethin' 'bout my baby)
Southern girl
(Woo, come on, come on)
Southern girl
(Ow)
