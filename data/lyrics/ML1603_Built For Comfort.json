 "lyrics": "5 ContributorsBuilt for Comfort LyricsSome folk built like this, some folk built like that\nBut the way I'm built, Don't you call me fat\nBecause I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed\nBut I got everything all that a good girl need\nSome folk rip and roar, some folk b'lieve in signs\nBut if you want me baby, you got to take your time\nBecause I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed\nBut I got everything all the good girl need\nAnd I ain't got no diamonds, I ain't got no gold\nBut I do have love to satisfy your soul\nBecause I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed\nBut I got everything all you good women needYou might also likeEmbed"
