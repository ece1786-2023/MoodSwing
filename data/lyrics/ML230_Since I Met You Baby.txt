5 ContributorsSince I Met You Baby Lyrics[Verse 1]
Since I met you, baby, my whole life has changed
Since I met you, baby, my whole life has changed
And everybody tells me that I am not the same

[Verse 2]
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
'Cause since I met you, baby, all I need is you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Since I met you, baby, I'm a happy man
Since I met you, baby, I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try to please you in every way I canYou might also likeEmbed
