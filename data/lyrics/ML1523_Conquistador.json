 "lyrics": "1 ContributorConquistador (live) LyricsConquistador your stallion stands\nIn need of company\nAnd like some angel's haloed brow\nYou reek of purity\nI see your armour-plated breast\nHas long since lost its sheen\nAnd in your death mask face\nThere are no signs which can be seen\n\nAnd though I hoped for something to find\nI could see no maze to unwind\n\nConquistador a vulture sits\nUpon your silver shield\nAnd in your rusty scabbard now\nThe sand has taken seed\nAnd though your jewel-encrusted blade\nHas not been plundered still\nThe sea has washed across your face\nAnd taken of its fill\n\nAnd though I hoped for something to find\nI could see no maze to unwind\n\nConquistador there is no time\nI must pay my respect\nAnd though I came to jeer at you\nI leave now with regret\nAnd as the gloom begins to fall\nI see there is no, only all\nAnd though you came with sword held high\nYou did not conquer, only die\nYou might also likeAnd though I hoped for something to find\nI could see no maze to unwindEmbed"
