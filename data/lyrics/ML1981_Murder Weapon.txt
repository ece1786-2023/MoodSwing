3 ContributorsMurder Weapon LyricsShine your gun, shine your gun
Shine your gun right now
Shine your gun, shine your gun
It's time for the showdown

I never want to hold the gun without the glove's upon my hand
The one of the finger prints on the murder weapon
One of them come I'm gonna kill them dead
Two of them come I'm gonna run them red
Went out to chase I'll send hem to their beds
And another one dead

Shine your gun, shine your gun
Shine your gun rude boy
Shine your gun, shine your gun
Shine your gun right now

Watch I got my Glock on my waist
Watch I got my Glock on my waist
You want to get acquainted to Betsy
Or you want to meet my Glock Charlie, yeah

Watch I got my Glock on my waist
Watch I got my Glock on my waist
You want to get acquainted to Betsy
Or you want to meet my Glock Charlie, yeah
