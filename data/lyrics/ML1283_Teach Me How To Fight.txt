4 ContributorsTeach Me How To Fight LyricsThere's some things I forget
And if it's wrong, I keep it in check
'Cause what could I do?
And if we go out tonight
Would there be blood on your shoe
And would it taste like better shit?
'Cause I don't know

Can you teach me how to fight?
Show me what it's like to give back pain
Show me how you throw, throw him down

There were times in the past
If I had the nerve, I couldn't make it last
Courage wasted in the night
And is it really so hard?
Tell your body to forget the words
Pushing you to run
'Cause I don't know

Can you teach me how to fight?
Show me what it's like to give back pain
Show me how you throw, throw him downYou might also likeEmbed
