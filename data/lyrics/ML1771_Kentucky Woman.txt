6 ContributorsKentucky Woman Lyrics[Verse 1]
Kentucky woman
She shine with her own kind of light
She'd look at you once
In a day, that's all wrong
Well, it's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
And I love her
God knows, I love her

[Chorus]
Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman

[Verse 2]
Well, she ain't the kind make heads turn
At the drop of her name
But something inside that she's got
Turns you on just the same

[Pre-Chorus]
And she loves me
God knows, she loves me
You might also like[Chorus]
Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman

[Bridge]
I don't want much
The good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch
From that one girl
And life is
Sweet and good

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no doubt
I'm talkin' about

[Chorus]
Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman

[Bridge]
I don't want much
The good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch
From that one girl
And life is
Sweet and good
[Pre-Chorus]
There ain't no doubt
I'm talkin' about

[Chorus]
Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman

[Outro]
