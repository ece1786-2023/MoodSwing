 "lyrics": "1 ContributorLife, Love & Laughter LyricsDon't look back, it won't do any good\nDon't look ahead you'll just be misunderstood\nEverything you need could be right in front of you\nIt doesn't take much to see what is true\nThey say we are going to die if we go on like this\nWho do you believe? Every story has a twist\nTake a look around, tell me what you see\nPeople in the world just trying to be free\nWhat about all those things you could have done but you don't?\nThey say things happen for a reason, you don't do them, they won't\n\nI'm looking for life, love and laughter\n\nEverything in between and what happens after\nI'm looking for life, lookin for love, lookin for laughter\n\nThings are gunna change, they never stay the same\nThat's why we're fighting a war but the people are to blame\nYou can only stand up for what you believe\nDon't be blinded by the power of greed\nWhat about all those things you could have done but you don't?\nThey say things happen for a reason, you don't do them, they won't\n\nI'm looking for life, love and laughter\nEverything in between and what happens after\nI'm looking for life, love and laughter\nEverything in between and what happens after\nLooking for laughter\nSee Donavon Frankenreiter LiveGet tickets as low as $39You might also likeWe got everything we need\nAll the money in the world, want to buy what we see\nDreams are worth more than gold\nSome people hold on, some people let go\nThe stars all come out at night\nThe velvet sky, all so bright\nI feel so close to you\nBecause I see what you see too\n\nI'm looking for life, love and laughter\nEverything in between and what happens after\nLooking for life\nI'm looking for life, love and laughter\nEverything in between and what happens after\nWhat happens after!\nI'm looking for life, love and laughter\nEverything in between and what happens after\nWhat happens after?Embed"
