4 ContributorsAll By Myself Lyrics[Verse 1]
Little girl, don't you understand?
I wanna be your loving man

[Chorus]
All by myself, all by myself
I don't want no one to love you
I wanna love you all by myself

[Verse 2]
You'll find little girl you know it too
Don't you know I'm in love with you

[Chorus]
All by myself, all by myself
I don't want no one to love you
I wanna love you all by myself

[Verse 3]
Meet me in the parlor 'bout half past one
We will go on out and have some fun

[Chorus]
All by ourself, all by ourself
We don't need nobody with us
We gonna do it all by ourself
