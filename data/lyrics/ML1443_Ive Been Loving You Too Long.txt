3 ContributorsIâ€™ve Been Loving You Too Long Lyrics[Verse: Tina Turner]
I've been loving you too long, I don't wanna stop now
You are tired and you want to be free
But my love for you is growing stronger
You see, you've become a habit to me
Ooh, I've been loving you that much too long
Please don't make me stop now
Oh, I don't wanna stop now

[Outro: Tina Turner]
I've been loving a little too long
I dont wanna stop now, oh, I don't wanna
Please don't make me stop now
Oh, don't make me stop now
I'm down on my bended knees, don't make me stop now
Oh, don't make me stop now
Baby, baby, I love you
Honey, honey, child, don't you know that I love you
I said I, I love you with all my heart and soul
Don't make me stop, don't make me stop now
Oh, I love you; oh, said I love you
Oh, don't make me, don't make me stop now
Oh, oh, you you you, you can make me do anything you want me to do
And I'll, I'll even say anything you want me to say
Buy anything you want me to buy ya
If you, if you just stay and make, and make love to me
If you, if you just make me say, "Oh, oh, baby, oh, oh, baby"
Baby, come on, baby, sock it, sock it, sock it
Sock it to me, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby, baby, baby, don't make me stop now
Oh, oh, I love you, don't make me stop now, baby, oh...You might also likeEmbed
