2 ContributorsKiss You Back (Single Version) Lyrics[Intro: Digital Underground, Shock G & Money B]
Alright, let's go
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa pop
Yeah, shimmy, shimmy cocoa pop
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa pop
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa pop
We-we chocolate crossover
Yeah, we chocolate crossover
See me, cocoa, might go pop
I'm cocoa and I might go pop

[Verse 1: Shock G & Money B]
Now it's about time that I cleared this, so pardon me, miss
But I'd like for you to hear this
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
You see, I feel real good inside, and it's just from your nearness
There's no need for you to fear this
Kiss me, I'll kiss you back (Mwah)
Well, ya look kinda cute to me, I think we can achieve this
Plus you act like you need this
Kiss me and I'll kiss you back
(Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo)
You act real fly, Money B's not buyin' it
Quit denyin' it, you're better off tryin' it
Freak me girl and I'll freak you back
(Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo)
Through any kinda weather, will me and you forever stay together?
Well, I just don't know, but I'll tell ya what, though
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (Kiss you back)
And I guess you wanna know if I'm gonna be around
I ain't sure but I'll tell you what I do know
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
(Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo) (Kiss you back)
Alright, let's do this

If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
Yeah, kiss me and I'll kiss you back
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
You with it? 'Cause if you with it, I'm with it, yo
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (Yeah, mwah)
Just kiss me then I'll kiss you back
I'll kiss you back (I'll kiss you back)

[Verse 2: Shock G]
Now I'm hopin' that you hear me, 'cause I love it when you're near me
And I'm tellin' you sincerely
That if you kiss me, girl, I'll kiss you back
'Cause I really, really, really like you
And I just want to make it clear (Ahem)
We're gonna keep it fair and square
Kiss me and I'll kiss you back
Yo, it's not funny, real cute is what you say to me
But any other way, you play me
If you love me then I'll love you back
(Love me and I'll love you back)
When you say I get the most out of this it kind of bothers me
A fair exchange ain't no robbery
Love me, girl, and I'll love you back
(Love me, girl, and I'll love you back)
[Pre-Chorus: Shock G]
Now I'm hopin' that you hear me 'cause I love it when you're near me
And I know you know I knew this, so I guess that we can do this
Kiss me and I'll kiss you back
Alright, sing it with me again, come on

[Chorus: Digital Underground, Shock G]
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (Yeah, kiss me)
Come on, keep it going
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (Yeah, kiss me)
Yeah, ladies?
If you love me, boy, I'll love you back
Oh, yeah? Yo, I'm with it
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
Alright, alright, that's cool, now let's change it up a little bit

[Post-Chorus: Digital Underground, Shock G & Money B]
If you play with my tummy, I'll tickle your feet
If you play with my tummy, I'll tickle your feet (You know?)
If you touch me here, I'll touch you there
Yeah, put lotion on me
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (I'll kiss you back)
If you love me, girl, I'll love you back (I'll love you back)

[Bridge: Shock G]
We know what you go through, sometimes we put you down
People treat you cold when they know you sleep around
We never want to disrespect you and don't have to tell anyone in town
But if you love me then I'll love you back, I'm askin' if you're down
[Chorus: Digital Underground]
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (Kiss me)
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (And I'll kiss you back)
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back

[Outro: Digital Underground, Shock G]
If you play with my feet, I'll tickle your tummy
If you love me, boy, I'll love you back
Yeah, I like it when the girls do it
If you love me, boy, I'll love you back
Come on, ladies, one more time, kick it
If you love me, boy, I'll love you back
'Cause if you kiss me then I'll kiss you back
But if you hit me then I'll hit you back
("You smack me and I'll smack you back")
If you scratch me here, I'll scratch you thereEmbed
