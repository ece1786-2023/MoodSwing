Color in sky, Prussian blue
Scarlet fleece changes hue
Crimson ball sinks from view

[Chorus]
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love)

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, kiss me once more
Fill me with song
Allah, kiss me once more
That I may, that I may

[Chorus]
Wear my love like Heaven (Wear my love like)
Wear my love like Heaven (Wear my love)
(La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la)

[Verse 2]
Color sky, Havana lake
Color sky, rose carmethene
Alizarin crimson

Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love)

Wear my love like Heaven (Wear my love like)

Cannot believe what I see
All I have wished for will be
All our race proud and free

[Chorus]
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love like)
Wear your love like Heaven (Wear your love)
