And no lie\n\nI may have a problem\nI know why you backed out\nMy pride\u2026\n\nWould not let me be wrong ever\nBut somebody has to bend\nOh, Everlyn, won\u2019t you let me in\nHear, now, the words on my tongue\nSee, now, the tears and then\nOh, Everlyn, won\u2019t you let me back inYou might also likeEmbed"
