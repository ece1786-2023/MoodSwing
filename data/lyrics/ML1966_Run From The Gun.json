 "lyrics": "1 ContributorRun from the Gun LyricsI got mad at history\nPicked it up and fell in love with everything\nMen and pen and paper\nLike the wind you let 'em in now they'll never leave\nRun from the gun don't be afraid\nRun from the gun where the dead lay\nRun from the gun don't be afraid\nRun from the gun...\nYou were sweet as poison\nDried my mouth took me out and left me glad\nYou did me no favors\nIt was dumb and the last one that I ever had\nRun from the gun don't be afraid\nRun from the gun where the dead lay\nRun from the gun don't be afraid\nRun from the gun...\nIt was loaded with the pressure\nToo much pressure to be measured\nI was holding off the wrong and the right...\nI got let down gently\nNever even knew the end was on the way\nThen I made my peace there\nOpened eyes and my surprise it was a waste\nRun from the gun don't be afraid\nRun from the gun where the dead lay\nRun from the gun don't be afraid\nRun from the gun..You might also likeEmbed"
