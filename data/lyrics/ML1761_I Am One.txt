I am one as you are three
Try to find a messiah in your trinity
Your city to burn, your city to burn
Try to look for something in your city to burn
You’ll burn

[Chorus]
Am I as I seem?
I’m down
Down
So down

[Verse 2]
Time is right for a guiding light
Try to turn to reasons in your bitter life
Your city to burn, your city to burn
Try to look for something in your city to burn
You’ll burn

[Bridge]
See you, don’t you just want to
See you, I am one
See you, don’t you just want to
See you
