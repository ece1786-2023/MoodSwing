Fight anger with anger
Blow to the head
Destroy the liars

Blunt force trauma
Treatment fall
Bulldozer
Decimate destroy

Blunt force trauma
Blunt force trauma
Blunt force trauma
Blunt force trauma

Chaos lover
Arise the disorder
Destroyer
Kill without order

Blunt force trauma
Violence disorder
Suicide bomber
Now you in a coma

Blunt force trauma
Blunt force trauma
Blunt force trauma
Blunt force trauma

When you feel this pain
You'll go insane
And now you bleed till you bleed it out
Suffer the pain
As your body drops outEmbed
