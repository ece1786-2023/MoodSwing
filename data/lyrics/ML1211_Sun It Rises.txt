16 ContributorsSun It Rises Lyrics[Intro]
Red squirrel in the morning
Red squirrel in the evening
Red squirrel in the morning
I'm coming to take you home

[Verse]
Sun risin' over my head
In the morning when I rise
Hold me dear into the night
Sun, it will rise soon enough

[Outro]
The sun rising, dangling there
Golden and fair, in the skyYou might also like4Embed
