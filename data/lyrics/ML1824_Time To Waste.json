 "lyrics": "7 ContributorsTime to Waste LyricsThere's someone down below blowing you a kiss\nThey watch from their windows\nAs all arms fall to their sides, and all eyes fix\nOn the death of tomorrow\n\nAnd you found everything you need\nTo make a life complete\nCompletely revolting, and they have safety and relief\nFor sale up the street\nI see you in line everyday\n\nYou had time to waste and I'm not sorry\nSuch a basket case, hide the cutlery\nI had time to kill, it's dead and buried\nYou've got guts to spill, but no one trustworthy\n\nThese creatures are waking up in these dark trees\nWaiting like vultures\nEyes roll back, turn white in time to feed\nThey salivate in hunger\n\nFor you and everything they need\nTo make a death complete\nCompletely unnatural and salvation lies\nBehind those dead eyes\nThat watch you while you sleep every night\nSee Alkaline Trio LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also likeAnd you had time to waste and I'm not sorry\nSuch a basket case, hide the cutlery\nI had time to kill its dead and buried\nYou've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy\n\nYou had time to waste and I'm not sorry\nSuch a basket case, hide the cutlery\nI had time to kill its dead and buried\nYou've got guts to spill but no one trustworthyEmbed"
