 "lyrics": "6 ContributorsI May Hate Myself in the Morning LyricsAin't it just like one of us\nTo pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks\nAnd say how you been, I've been wondering if\nMaybe you've been thinkin about me\nAnd somewhere in the conversation\nAn old familiar invitation always arrives\nI may hate myself in the morning\nBut I'm gonna love you tonight\n\nEveryone's known someone that they\nJust can't help but want\nEven though we just can't make it work out\nThe want to, lingers on\nSo once again, we wind up in each other's arms\nPretending that it's right\nAnd I may hate myself in the morning\nBut I'm gonna love you tonight\n\nI know it's wrong, but it ain't easy movin' on\nSo why can't two friends\nRemember the good times once again\n\nTomorrow when I wake up\nI'll be feelin' a little guilty, a little sad\nThinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad\nI guess that's what it is all lonely\nLate night calls like this, that we try to find\nI may hate myself in the morning\nBut I'm gonna love you tonight\nI may hate msyelf in the morning\nBut I'm gonna love you tonightYou might also likeEmbed"
