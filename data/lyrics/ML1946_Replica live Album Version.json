 "lyrics": "2 ContributorsBig jimmy 16 5 LyricsI can do this a hundred times a day times ten/\nSo big ask Thomas Hobbes I was there when he wrote Leviathan/\nGuard my noble causes/\nA fighter for virtue and love/\nPursuit of peace and charm/\nReady to love you down and put you to sleep but I\u2019m not the song/\nHitting bongs rioting for endearing sins with efficacy and conviction/\nForced luck automatically becomes bad luck/\nFor the industry to become healthy it goes from sicken dispositions/\nStrident students of erudition on the path to perdition I\u2019m far from the avenue of loose intentions/\nAre you ready player one?/\nYes I am are you coming to planet earth to get an underhanded curse/\nCrush anybody in my way to attain this immovable and unstoppable grace/\nSetting the pace to relay information on unacknowledged subject/\nBrowsing traces of unnamed files to learn about chemical imbalances that was found inside tombs where they see malice\u2019s/\nMiraculous paintings touched by angels of will verified and identified by tactless deals\n\nLet me enclose this verse of perfection smothered in positive dope to smoke/\nFear of the unknown clones and I\u2019m closer to death/\nIn the desert of dreams thirsty for a drink I sprint now/\nA vessel of truth to embody and share with the masses /\nMaking level headed decisions of how I am going to reconcile opposite offers:\nI\u2019m the prince and the pauper/\nI am ever lasting like the gob stopper/\nPop her locker well I never been to Harlem but I\u2019m her Globetrotter/\nNot my name but I felt like win the Oscar/\nLet me be the champion of this cause so win this round in my boxer going looney Hippity Hopper/\nPractice what you preach and teach I\u2019m here to exist you just cease/\nI\u2019m an artist at a western rodeo ready to draw my hand/\nFinishing touches on my endgame/\nDisappear and reappear my madness is magic/\nHold on tight I\u2019m ready to think write speak poetically upgraded and about to graduate/\nLet essay this over the turntables/\nScouting for talent this non violent is once in a lifetime what Aliyah said/\nYou might also likeI don\u2019t care who you are or where your from/\nI see high society they\u2019re healthy wealthy and dumb like the stooges so I\u2019m numb/\nHow could I be so cumbersome/\nLet me essay my target and depict me the assailant/\nI nailed it didn\u2019t fail it just flailed it/\nI\u2019m a vivid detailed picture that you can see so be amused/\nWhen I spit this Cyborg dyslexic cypher playing with a rubiks cube /\nNever addicted to no nicotine on a neon street with a cyber security leak /\nNext to a quirky shrink who shrieks havoc/\nI\u2019m doing fantastic like mr. so thanks for asking/\nA repetitive cross over from every genre relaxing my feet up in the Ramada formulating cures for my aching and aging sagas in Romania/\nSinister projects without much chit chat only to be stewed in Virginia witchcraft/\nBackwoods thinking got me outside looking at the box thinking/\nFor a moment my patience was on a tight rope so let me spin my sonnets/\nA din won an award once they laced a genius on it/\nThey Gunn a swarm like a thousand hornets for my performance/\nEnhance my space big house nice pool some tunes to groove on let the melody play so I can be like a camera lens and zoom in/\n\n\nMore romantic than the three languages Spanish French and Italian/\nMy suburban living is heroic giving my troop uplifting divid ends I\u2019m splendid kid in a German sense/\nA Japan hut with a Jamaican quiet queens touch/\nEating shrimp scamp a major mage genie lamp watch lady n the tramp/\nPrague and niece I\u2019m on the way and get to the Eritrean I\u2019m soon be seeing/\nEverything I say is hypnotizing and continues to be conflicted constricted righteous and rigid exposed on contingent in lay mans terms/\nMy pseudonym is my nickname big the old soul yo we can go blow for blow/\nSee you on death row for trying to pawn off and plagiarize my lyrics as your own a fake dr writing prescriptions like Mario/\nScribbling down ideas on my trek was an epic one to recount seeing this epidemic get faster as I drummed up this epiphany to have a destiny and a fetishized wordplay/\nThis chiseled quartz looks real but it is secretly ersatz/\nMade it this far at my point of eureka you reek of sorrow see you tomorrow /\nI feel bad for the euphemism and the youth in asia(euthanasia)/\nLet be here for the clarity of the sport then become evanescent/\nHere we go I\u2019m moving like a turtle on the beach to slow so I won\u2019t get arrested by this ex officio/\nYou just excoriated my heroic entrance /\nThem charges were excruciating but now the judge exculpated all of them/\n\nYour can not stay here now you are expatriated/\nCrimes committed were heinous dangerous and extemporaneous to say the least /\nMedical medieval dark ages kept my soul in agonizing pain when I left/\nNow there is none like Agatha Christie\u2019s novel/\nYeah I see a thief run in a Jeep tired in deep mud seeking his Fiefdoms/\nI\u2019m just an apparent figment of your imagination when I display figurative rhymes/\nBefore college elders would give me an acknowledged head nod a simple sign of foreknowledge /\nKatanas strike fear in those fools who shake like maracas and always ignite some damn fracas/\nLook is in an aura or a wave of frisson/\nI can\u2019t see my rival he might become fugacious/\nRead a few pages of biblical scriptures on my furlough from work/\nToo many gaps and gaffs when start to possess my raps issue them on waxing walls /\nLet me fix this with some gaiety and recover this gainsay/\nThis gamut stretches video games to Shakespearean Hamlet so I gambol those pamphlets/\nThink sinking motion pockets empty and my trade of work to finance my bills was garroted/\nWith my pencil made out of England steel my manners stern mixed with a knighting hood of genteel/\nI\u2019m waiting patient to endure this forthcoming gradation to my admiration/\nAin\u2019t nothing like your mom and ain\u2019t\n\nGrappling with uncertainty haunts me at night when searching for grandiose solutions/\nI made it to the top of my rank I feel so harangue/\nI\u2019m a genius within a heterogeneous fit in this world perplexed by the media\u2019s contusion and rallying up for s revolution of mind body and soul /\nCommence to hew then resew the chapters of our lives delicately/\nLet me address this social in media res before I expose fearless antagonists/\nIn essence the raps I display are full of vivid vindictive images and incandescent/\nAll my ally\u2019s turned to enemies feel fiendish and try to upset us but I won\u2019t let us dissolve/\nI\u2019m tiresome from guessing along with gyrating about homeless problems/\nMy frustration was communicated to my comrades by liaison/\nMy plans digressed and fell backwards got hassled then began to ramshackle/\nBackfiring my telepathic dreams inserting computerized and fixed signals on temples/\nThose clothes were the zeitgeist in the Great Depression I\u2019m late for my blessings/\nA needle in a haystack rewind my playback for this wheedle/\nGrant me the space so it can vouchsafed/\nScrew a motive to carry out bosses orders is my votive/\nI need some logos on my boat lift oh shit/\nIt flatters me cause sometimes I\u2019m broke in my scene it\u2019s vogue but for show and tell my shoes are brogue/\nI play the game not the rappers name but I\u2019ll twist a (twist ya) sista and watch you undress your soul through a vista/\nViscid places and distant faces/\nLook at this facade in the mirage it\u2019s kind of odd looking at her visage not eating sausage/\nI love the arts my nickname should have been Virtu I never meant to hurt you/\nBe careful what you wish for it\u2019s somber going from filthy rich to piss poor/\nIndivisible my birth rights undeniable your just a bunch of bull jam packed/\nIm not even vincible/\nD like a school kids lunch able/\nI brought to the party a maiden of truth when she was sagacious in her youth/\nTo swallow your pride and humble yourself you will need a tablespoon/\nDon\u2019t sweat my unique technique as you read this vignette/\nThis gambit in the pit let it enervate it\u2019s speech/\nA definite classic remorseful and resourceful as it gets/\nWhy lie cause these colors don\u2019t die/dye so by cause you can\u2019t vie/\nAnd I remain an explicit dude real rude mouth full of vicissitudes/\nBehave child and be a nice boy cause here comes the Viceroy/\n\nMy love send letters are prestige indeed they cling to shingles that are now vestige/\nBest believe when I walk into a room I come in peace/\nWho\u2019s next to go up this vertex in present context/\nShow me my acting cue because I\u2019m set all this questions they asked me I gave me back in verisimilitude/\nBack in denial the skies of my dreams red and blue but now I\u2019m in venial/\nMind altering substances making my mentality vendible and bendable/\nA velvet night I said it once don\u2019t make it twice/\nUrchin looks leave to capsize my adventure with urgent crooks/\nHot like the smogs from the pyro in the nostrils of Spyro don\u2019t be mad I\u2019m just a Tyro/\nEat my own flow like a gyro I don\u2019t know so I\u2019m about to blow up Egypt I\u2019m thinking Cairo with some high flow on a oops that was a typo baby I\u2019m a psycho from Ohio/\nMy heart and brain have gave out doctors and surgeons trying to revive me/\nLike Christmas it\u2019s a cheerful spirit when I kick this verse with ya nurse /\nMet a fake replica of a man named Erica who was not from America/\nOn my list I have to usher out this gist I solemnly swear to spit as I sear and swelter raps before my tryst /\nThrowing a tantrum that\u2019s tantamount to a child won\u2019t help you either/\nCrisp fresh brew a hint of apple cider/\nFacial expression truculent and my meal was far from succulent /\nI am but my my Spider-Man senses and mood changes all the time/\nI need a love of my own but now I ain\u2019t a average white band\nAll in ample time sipping some maple syrup within the confines of my soul as I attempt victorious strides/\nI\u2019m going back to the old me since we ain\u2019t on good termagant terms again/\nReciting and inciting hot lines on my lawn at my chateau beside the tableau/\n\nA jar of of greed and a pot for my need /\nI want what I want so stunt my back has no front/\nI like to see a battle of wits Donald trump vs forest gump vs chuck norris sun/\nLet me get the message straight so it won\u2019t be fixed for fusion then get knocked by a fissure then I put the binary back into a fission as I\u2019m fishing then she likes math class cause I\u2019m here long division/\nA notorious rap performance coming with cosmic weapons that\u2019s my squad rep pin/\nOfficial scholars of adversity find my flow hard to answer like a mystery suicidal murder/\nI\u2019m just a kid enchanted by your magic in an incubus related to Icarus /\nSee you later Roy I\u2019m not a toy I\u2019m fully focused my route I want my Paperboy/\nHotter than a cup of java don\u2019t Botha in Turkey sweet tooth someone pass me the Baklava/\nMy Servants are loyal I\u2019m polished with the finest oil and if must wear my crown to be royal/\nWanna place ya bets I\u2019m a gift in real rare form from the French my new name is Lafayette/\nPlay me turn up the radio cause I wanna know what\u2019s on my cassette eject don\u2019t flex come correct I abject now spit into the mic and read the alphabet/\nDrinking from the front finest winery separating my fake and truth in my refinery/\n\nMy depression state reclines and unwinds for the given time/\nMy anxiety takes over my Central nervous system/\nI\u2019m part paralyzed and am getttti nag uh speech impediment/\nNo more schizophrenia now I\u2019m eating a lot more than I chew/\nTied to my inner sick narcissistic self mirroring my reality/\nMy thoughts are graphical then go skinny like I\u2019m entering anorexia/\nBars scattered all over the mixed up could be early signs of dyslexia/\nPlease park your breaks pumping don\u2019t let these naysayers get the best of ya/\nI\u2019m young generating Alzheimer\u2019s on documented papers so I sign there/\nThis flow is mine in a neat form I\u2019m ocd for sure this too neat/\nLook no Aspergers in my 16 bars unless there\u2019s some form of autism in my bars/\nThis separation anxiety is upon on trial awaiting its notoriety/\nCan\u2019t keep focused the picture foggy ADHD symptoms triggering my career/\nCan\u2019t hope it won\u2019t be quoted just be heroic and stoic pleas not protozoic/\nMy style range is simple I\u2019m can go from being on a street corner/\nSuited down 3 pc on live tv talking to a fox republican news reporter/\n\nI\u2019m from Maryland my state 301 is where I\u2019m recording /\nAnd I have big dreams to the hip hop version with expressions like Ed Norton/\nMy jewels are bright but my flight out of orbit we abortin/\nYou get extorted for not being able to afford it/\nLet me aboard the ship and distort this flick/\nGo to the judge and report this snitch/\nIn the walk of fame I\u2019m a star now let support my hit/\nMy flow hotter in the streets than on stage shucks my bars hotter than a battle like Cassidy vs Eminem/\nToo much to bicker and noisy banter/\nI\u2019m cool jack laid back legs up with glasses on and some black glasses on playing the theme from pink panther /\nCut the product and middleman in the store out so I could it it straight no whole sale/\nNull and void when it makes the mail/\nUnder pressure I\u2019m good at conspiracy theories you won\u2019t see traces of me in the sky like chem trails/\nDosing off on the side line seeking some thick tails/\nI\u2019m a brag about you put a post on my book then snap a pic about you/\nWords on tablets from cavemen every sentence I meant it set in stone now I carry my statue/\n\nMy lines my bars are hand written and I\u2019m loud when I tip toe around the live show/\nYou can get super hard like that scene where that native radishes his eye brow you know Apacalypto/\nPaid in full but I\u2019m not big money Mitch/\nFull of comedy delivering 16s in nine months like babies I\u2019m a dr call me Kosevich/\nWhen I was down and out my baby momma took care of me/\nMy own family and friends hated on me they was like the Pharisees/\nOn my own way to stardom reaching success I\u2019m a rare breed/\nLook closer then pick the stems out the weed cause if you don\u2019t then you got ripped off indeed/\nI\u2019m something big the mayor need to see/\nPlayer please I been around you just didn\u2019t know me since we graduated Cooley High/\nHutches over scratching my head making a hunch about this/\nOn a run depicted as a fugitive really grasping life on its terms/\nSince you don\u2019t want beef I guess your a vegetarian/\nBut you gotta knuckle up like The Warriors or your body is the casket you get buried in/\nI don\u2019t try to fit or stand out I just do me/\nBecause a man that\u2019s spits like big Jim is not going drive an 2018 yellow Audi/\n\nDo your own thing a different avenue can get you that different cash/\nHigh School and college was something I did pass/\nFocused on me not worrying about what them other dudes do/\nShit I tell em just do you cause /\nThey gonna hate on you when you cruise that 2018 BMW/\nAvoiding all the losers games jail kids you can\u2019t take of and drugs/\nEating my money up giving into bs/\nNext time I put sixteens down paper I need a bank to verify and co sign my rhymes/\nFelt like I read this on that mag high times/\nI\u2019m on shore but I think I could hang glide/\nCause if it is a scheme and it\u2019s cut short/\nThen we express mail your corpse with a fee of course/\nIt\u2019d me tighten my axel wow wait my flow is on fire like the hair of the clown on twisted metal no specters/\nLeft my adversaries confused when they get swirled and twirled on sand/\nThis is real life my ex girl took the lyrical gun and got em blown like Kirby s Dream Land/\nA ball of confusion too much temptations/\n\nYou a Simpson simpleton I\u2019m on a trek ask Homer/\nWent to court for my sex scene she wanted in Latin so I gave her a pro boner/\nYou count my cards like you count my bars fraud/\nI love my soup my special brand of cream of broccoli/\nYou collapse when I spit verses giving out life sentences like court cases easily/\nIts a shame you have to diss people just to get your views up/\nBar x bar pound for pound for pound I astound the crowd when it cheers/\nImaginary players vs extraordinary pimps/\nWe as real and raw as they come out my vendor/\nI\u2019m so advanced I even was signed to Mensa/\nI\u2019m teaching my girl the tricks where\u2019s\nShirley temple she calls me Bojangles/\nYou don\u2019t have to be in the eat but I\u2019m a dish sense my steam on this et tu fe/\nIt\u2019s all just a game playing with words so my last name is smith/\nHustle flows on my tapes a beautiful mind I\u2019m in my Russell Crowe/\nEject the elects now I direct when I dissect my butterfly see its effect/\nEnd of story i paid alimony for testimony your baloney get clowned like homey then quote my allegory/\n\nI\u2019m insane in my asylum I maintain/\nA war hero for hip hop rip to John McCain/\nMy initials are not AK/\nI\u2019m up high like the soul plane/\nOh my god what an omen/\nStay wiser than Yoda saying yahoo/\nMy ladies are circus freaks showing you taboo/\nStuck on me like an artists tatoo/\nThey want the green I appear out of thin air The great gazoo/\nDo it when you die so I put a halo over you/\nIn my radius they play us/\nLet me stretch my arms out Goro vs dr Octavia\u2019s in the sky my ship Gradius/\nA lot of liquor and great ideas/\nMonster madness riding out on a grounder mustang/\nLike Chinese stickers im stick when you pull me apart/\nIt\u2019s too hot in the summer time to spit something cool I think/\nYou made a killing no guns Just my pens wielding I sit high putting in work like 1930s Manhattan construction workers on buildings/\n\nTrump is our president/\nMaryland is my residence/\nMy family was heaven sent/\nWhen I leave for a long time I\u2019m home sick/\nOutside roasting marshmallows on an open fire/\nIce cold winds and razor sharp flies whistle/\nBody aches metal plates commence to whittle/\nSheets of loose leaf paper I write my diary on/\nApron on big Jim marinate and serenade the juices when they burst/\n16 bars in mansion haunted watch out for the ghost/\nA rumor that ain\u2019t real it was just a hoax/\nIt is spiteful to be you cause your arrogance will over turn/\nI play for keeps you take the losses/\nGreat things comes those who wait patiently/\nWhen you rush the adrenaline rises my blood pressure levels/\nMy name ain\u2019t Melvin second round I want helpings and your my family but no Cosby show like Elvin/\n\nYou can be rich or poor/\nYou can want peace or war/\nYou can\u2019t get your time back but you can but everything in the store/\nTime goes on we let bygones go and change our perspective at the door/\nListen up I could have died fighting/\nBut god chose me for a different course/\nI could have chose the drug route but instead I used my mind to find my fountain of youth/\nI\u2019m a genius when I\u2019m on the mic/\nIf it\u2019s good for me to utilize than I want it plain and simple/\nI got one liners that strike fast like the ice climbers/\nThem hits take you back to the past did you use a pipe to smoke/\nI\u2019m on shore rapping with straight bars I\u2019m a dead toad/\nThese wanna be\u2019s are flops that just croak/\nPoof I\u2019m gone whodini in the land of Miami fine exotic ladies in many mini bikinis/\nGoing to my hardship carrying a soft chip on my shoulder eating a starfish/\nWatch out I got a fever and I\u2019m ready to explode at at a marksman/\n\nThe only thing I dread is the judge I\u2019m about to see so like the board game it\u2019s in the Risk/\nDrink my flow up it\u2019s brisk/\nReturn of the Jedi in my brothers Levi we fly high against the sith/\nDominate the landscape rise to the occasion I brought my ape/\nA grizzly bear on the loose about to chew you to smithereens/\nI\u2019m on live tv screen hitting you around the cypher but I\u2019m not butter bean/\nBe you in your rhymes find your own style don\u2019t try to be like some else/\nImitating demonstrating and elevating off their lives was not wise/\nI\u2019m a child so I\u2019m always learning to adjust to this maladaptive environment/\nMy mom name is penny and dad name is Trent/\nNever been to France but I can understand their accent when they need the rent/\nOn a Gondola passing to go see the magnificent works of art the country reproduced/\nFour more times I fight for my champion belt/\nA stampede roaring in causing some wobbling welts/\nTo each is his or her own/\nLights off when I kill these two idiots with idioms using one stone my skills are hone/\n\nI don\u2019t care I\u2019m the new mayor/\nTo be the boss you got to pay the fare so on act lasseiz you hear/\nLife comes with a price for most of us it ain\u2019t fair/\nMy hustle is rare so cross me I double dare/\nYo I\u2019m a clown having sex on my birthday I\u2019m Jack Napier/\nGod please forgive me for all my sin/\nMy guilty conscious brings them back to life bright like the hat on the Gortons fisherman/\nSupport my supply and demand principal/\nI\u2019m the one they call official but I ain\u2019t a school principle/\nAll on point feeding my family in my municipal/\nYou can tell I\u2019m real not fake by the way I was created look at the visual/\nJimmy Mack tell them you\u2019ll be back so just relax facts take off tax/\nA glitch in the system another matrix computer hack/\nIn my card game it\u2019s this gambit now I love to be the winner jack/\nHigher than the kite Franklin flew/\nOldies but goodies some Aretha tunes/\nNever met drake but I\u2019ll still his views/\n\nMy style is a one knockout piece hitter quitter/-\nThe tables turned like a do scratching when we last met/\nI\u2019m not a street fighter or a general like bison/\nBut I\u2019m stuck in space talking about physics Neil Degrasse tyson/\nMy bank account is broke but after the show I hope to see some ones/\nIt\u2019s all fun and games till it happens to you/\nI stay in programs to perfect my craft even after school/\nI\u2019m smart like a fish I need to eat my mackerel hear my mouth start to crackle/\nLounge in my own thoughts and zoning in my own mind/\nI made an offer you can\u2019t refuse/\nI\u2019m not amused by you comical stupid dudes/\nTell the truth I\u2019m tired of these bills and over repeated flukes/\nI don\u2019t smoke for free and I don\u2019t sell bars/\nYou want some I cook em for you then get you the wholesale/\nFresh out my oven you can smell and inhale the scent of oatmeal:/\nLemon colored car seats and golden plated rims is what I\u2019m on/\n\nBefore you can back out I stand firm in my conviction/\nYou ain\u2019t got a PhD like dr Mario fraud but you say you
