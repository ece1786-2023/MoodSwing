1 ContributorJohnny Cash Lyrics[Verse]
You began a search
I know many have tried
Not a blind man to guide you
For years let fate decide
So swallowed and followed and played through start to end
With the good weight all carried by your faithful friend

She wrote you a song and you bought a wedding dress
Having handsome bite buxom
Havin' ensured people met
Then sundry and nocturnal
You lay your peace to sleep
With your new love's good fortunes
And secrets safe to keep

[Chorus]
What will await you
Can tether no more
What's shrunken withers
In the path to your door

What awaits you
Can tether no more
What's shrunken withers
In the path to your door
You might also like[Verse]
You began a search
I know many have tried
Not a blind man to guide you
For years let fate decide
So swallowed and followed and played through start to end
With the good weight all carried by your faithful friend

[Chorus]
What will await you
Can tether no more
What's shrunken withers
In the path to your door

What awaits you
Can tether no more
What's shrunken withers
In the path to your door

[Chorus]
What will await you
Can tether no more
What's shrunken withers
In the path to your door

What will await you
Can tether no more
What's shrunken withers
In the path to your doorEmbed
