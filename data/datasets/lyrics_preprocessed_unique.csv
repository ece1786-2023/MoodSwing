i used to do it for the love a long time ago
and all i ever wanted was love
i used to love without fear a long time ago
then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
try to make me feel like i was unworthy
took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
truth was they never did deserve me no!
i had to lose myself so i could love you better
i had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
love you better, lose myself in love
and that?s just the way it is?
couldn?t tell me i was in love when i needed it
when, all i ever wanted was love
should a told me i was worth receiving it
but all i ever wanted was love
there?s something awkward about the selflessness it
takes to
give love and the good that it makes you!
true love can never really forsake you
but it took a little while just for me to see!

so i could make it better
i had to lose myself had to lose myself

and so it goes that i never meant to hurt you
couldn?t stay but i never meant to desert you
whole lot a things i just had to work through
time to heal and restore my self-worth too
confrontation of my fears and anxiety
cried a whole lot of years i suffered quietly
and though it may have taken years i can finally
tell you that you were always on my mind!
love you better baby better baby
so i could love you better baby

liars line the roads at dawn
watchful eyes are upon you held
sacred weapons to the sacred revealed to be unleashed its the council of hell
blood flows down the streets at night where wolves cry out for flesh
where a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby with the forms of the walking dead
unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
the undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
they dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck
his spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land
freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man
into the tower, never go; the horrors multiply
the gears can mince the strongest ones, leaving heroes paralyzed
the rivers flow with poison

ML1729,"here's a new dance craze that's sweepin' the nation
it's called the toxic waltz and it's causin' devastation
you're jumpin' up and down like a psycho circus clown
slammin' with waltzers all the way around
you get caught up in the whip, you're thrown into a flip
then you aim for someone's head to stain the floor red
give someone a kick to prove you're truly sick
bounce back from some blows and blood runs out your nose
flailing round and round and you're injury bound
waltz it up! the pit is it!
you can take your chance on this rough new dance
if you dare to dive in!
there are some that try, but they won't survive
they don't hit! 'cause they're wimps!
and this exercise helps you brutalise
with us! exodus!
everybody's doin' the toxic waltz
kick your friend in the head and have a ball
come on and do the toxic waltz
and slam your partner against the wall
good friendly, violent fun in store for all
get up off your ass and toxic waltz
if you hit the floor, you can always crawl!
you might also likeused to do the monkey, but now it's not cool
the twist and mashed potato are no exception to the rule
so don't be a dunce and dance like a runt
just throw your elbows with good friendly, violent fun
don't start to cry if you get a black eye
just dive back in and give another try
but too much action may leave you in traction
so you better get insurance no matter your endurance

get up on your feet
don't look so obsolete
and thrash like an athlete!
don't sit there on your ass
don't look like you got too much class
you'll be harassed!
you know we guarantee
this is the key
so rage or get the third degree!
you begin frontal assaults
and start your somersaults
and do the toxic waltz!

hardly spoke to folks around him

no one dared to ask his business
no one dared to make a slip
the stranger there among them
had a big iron on his hip

it was early in the morning
when he rode into the town
he came riding from the south side
slowly looking all around
""he's an outlaw loose and running""
came the whisper from each lip
""and he's here to do some business
with the big iron on his hip""

in this town there lived an outlaw
by the name of texas red
many men had tried to take him
and that many men were dead
he was vicious and a killer

and the notches on his pistol
numbered one and nineteen more

wasn't long before the story
was relayed to texas red
but the outlaw didn't worry
men that tried before were dead
twenty men had tried to take him
twenty men had made a slip
twenty-one would be the ranger
with the big iron on his hip

the morning passed so quickly
it was time for them to meet
it was twenty past eleven
when they walked out in the street
folks were watching from the windows
everybody held their breath
they knew this handsome ranger
was about to meet his death
'bout to meet his death

there was forty feet between them
when they stopped to make their play
and the swiftness of the ranger
is still talked about today
texas red had not cleared leather
'fore a bullet fairly ripped
and the ranger's aim was deadly

it was over in a moment
and the folks had gathered round
there before them lay the body
of the outlaw on the ground
